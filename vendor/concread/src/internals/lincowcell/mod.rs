//! A CowCell with linear drop behaviour
//!
//! YOU SHOULD NOT USE THIS TYPE! Normally concurrent cells do NOT require the linear dropping
//! behaviour that this implements, and it will only make your application
//! worse for it. Consider `CowCell` and `EbrCell` instead.

/*
 * The reason this exists is for protecting the major concurrently readable structures
 * that can corrupt if intermediate transactions are removed early. Effectively what we
 * need to create is:
 *
 * [ A ] -> [ B ] -> [ C ] -> [ Write Head ]
 *   ^        ^        ^
 *   read     read     read
 *
 * This way if we drop the reader on B:
 *
 * [ A ] -> [ B ] -> [ C ] -> [ Write Head ]
 *   ^                 ^
 *   read              read
 *
 * Notice that A is not dropped. It's only when A is dropped:
 *
 * [ A ] -> [ B ] -> [ C ] -> [ Write Head ]
 *                     ^
 *                     read
 *
 * [ X ] -> [ B ] -> [ C ] -> [ Write Head ]
 *                     ^
 *                     read
 * [ X ] -> [ X ] -> [ C ] -> [ Write Head ]
 *                     ^
 *                     read
 *
 *                   [ C ] -> [ Write Head ]
 *                     ^
 *                     read
 *
 * At this point we drop A and B. To achieve this we need to consider that:
 * - If WriteHead is dropped, C continues to live.
 * - If A/B are dropped, we don't affect C.
 * - Everything is dropped in order until a read txn exists.
 * - When we drop the main structure, no readers can exist.
 * - A writer must be able to commit to a stable location.
 *
 *
 *   T        T        T
 * [ A ] -> [ B ] -> [ C ] -> [ Write Head ]
 *   ^        ^        ^
 *   RRR      RR       R
 *
 *
 * As the write head proceeds, it must be able to interact with past versions to commit
 * garbage that is "last seen" in the formers generation.
 *

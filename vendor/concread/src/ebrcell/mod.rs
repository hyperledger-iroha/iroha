//! EbrCell - A concurrently readable cell with Ebr
//!
//! An [EbrCell] can be used in place of a `RwLock`. Readers are guaranteed that
//! the data will not change during the lifetime of the read. Readers do
//! not block writers, and writers do not block readers. Writers are serialised
//! same as the write in a `RwLock`.
//!
//! This is the Ebr collected implementation.
//! Ebr is the crossbeam-epoch based reclaim system for async memory
//! garbage collection. Ebr is faster than `Arc`,
//! but long transactions can cause the memory usage to grow very quickly
//! before a garbage reclaim. This is a space time trade, where you gain
//! performance at the expense of delaying garbage collection. Holding Ebr
//! reads for too long may impact garbage collection of other epoch structures
//! or crossbeam library components.
//! If you need accurate memory reclaim, use the Arc (`CowCell`) implementation.

# Builds and checks the SCCP v1 TON contracts (contracts/ton/sccp) with the
# pinned native Acton 1.2.0 / Tolk 1.4.2 toolchain (specs/sccp.md §5.5).
#
# Without a command it runs `all`: the Tolk test-vector freshness check,
# `acton fmt --check`, `acton build` (with the Tolk stdlib version check), the
# wrapper freshness check, the Acton emulator suite `tests/unit`, and the
# StateInit golden check of fixtures/sccp/ton_stateinit_v1.json. On first use
# the pinned Acton release archive is downloaded and verified by SHA-256 (see
# scripts/ton_sccp_builder.py). No Docker or Rosetta is involved.
#
# Usage: scripts/sccp_ton_contract_build.sh [--acton /abs/acton] [--offline] [command ...]
#   see `python3 scripts/ton_sccp_builder.py --help` for the commands.

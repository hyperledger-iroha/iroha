# Universal Account Guide

This guide distils the UAID (Universal Account ID) rollout requirements from
the Nexus roadmap and packages them into an operator + SDK focused walkthrough.
It covers UAID derivation, portfolio/manifest inspection, regulator templates,
and the evidence that must accompany every `iroha app space-directory manifest
publish` run (roadmap reference: `roadmap.md:2209`).

## 1. UAID quick reference

- UAIDs are `uaid:<hex>` literals where `<hex>` is a Blake2b-256 digest whose
  LSB is set to `1`. The canonical type lives in
  `crates/iroha_data_model/src/nexus/manifest.rs::UniversalAccountId`.
- Account records (`Account` and `AccountDetails`) now carry an optional `uaid`
  field so applications can learn the identifier without bespoke hashing.
- Hidden-function identifier policies can bind arbitrary normalized inputs
  (phone numbers, emails, account numbers, partner strings) to `opaque:` IDs
  under a UAID namespace. The on-chain pieces are `IdentifierPolicy`,
  `IdentifierClaimRecord`, and the `opaque_id -> uaid` index.
- Space Directory maintains a `World::uaid_dataspaces` map that ties each UAID
  to the dataspace accounts referenced by active manifests. Torii reuses that
  map for the `/portfolio` and `/uaids/*` APIs.
- `POST /v1/accounts/onboard` publishes a default Space Directory manifest for
  the global dataspace when none exists, so the UAID is immediately bound.
  Onboarding authorities must hold `CanPublishSpaceDirectoryManifest{dataspace=0}`.
- All SDKs expose helpers for canonicalising UAID literals (e.g.,
  `UaidLiteral` in the Android SDK). The helpers accept raw 64-hex digests
  (LSB=1) or `uaid:<hex>` literals and re-use the same Norito codecs so the
  digest cannot drift across languages.

## 1.1 Hidden identifier policies

UAIDs are now the anchor for a second identity layer:

- A global `IdentifierPolicyId` (`<kind>#<business_rule>`) defines the
  namespace, public commitment metadata, resolver verification key, and the
  canonical input normalisation mode (`Exact`, `LowercaseTrimmed`,
  `PhoneE164`, `EmailAddress`, or `AccountNumber`).
- A claim binds one derived `opaque:` identifier to exactly one UAID and one
  canonical `AccountId` under that policy, but the chain only accepts the
  claim when it is accompanied by a signed `IdentifierResolutionReceipt`.
- Resolution remains a `resolve -> transfer` flow. Torii resolves the opaque
  handle and returns the canonical `AccountId`; transfers still target the
  canonical account, not `uaid:` or `opaque:` literals directly.
- Policies can now publish BFV input-encryption parameters through
  `PolicyCommitment.public_parameters`. When present, Torii advertises them on
  `GET /v1/identifier-policies`, and clients may submit BFV-wrapped input
  instead of plaintext. Programmed policies wrap the BFV parameters in a
  canonical `BfvProgrammedPublicParameters` bundle that also publishes the
  public `ram_fhe_profile`; legacy raw BFV payloads are upgraded onto that
  canonical bundle when the commitment is rebuilt.
- The identifier routes go through the same Torii access-token and rate-limit
  checks as other app-facing endpoints. They are not a bypass around normal
  API policy.

## 1.2 Terminology

The naming split is intentional:

- `ram_lfe` is the outer hidden-function abstraction. It covers policy
  registration, commitments, public metadata, execution receipts, and
  verification mode.
- `BFV` is the Brakerski/Fan-Vercauteren homomorphic encryption scheme used by
  some `ram_lfe` backends to evaluate encrypted input.
- `ram_fhe_profile` is BFV-specific metadata, not a second name for the whole
  feature. It describes the programmed BFV execution machine that wallets and
  verifiers must target when a policy uses the programmed backend.

In concrete terms:

- `RamLfeProgramPolicy` and `RamLfeExecutionReceipt` are LFE-layer types.
- `BfvParameters`, `BfvCiphertext`, `BfvProgrammedPublicParameters`, and
  `BfvRamProgramProfile` are FHE-layer types.
- `HiddenRamFheProgram` and `HiddenRamFheInstruction` are internal names for
  the hidden BFV program executed by the programmed backend. They stay on the
  FHE side because they describe the encrypted execution mechanism rather than
  the outer policy or receipt abstraction.

## 1.3 Account identity versus aliases

Universal-account rollout does not change the canonical account identity model:

- `AccountId` remains the canonical, domainless account subject.
- `AccountAlias` values are separate SNS bindings on top of that subject. A
  domain-qualified alias such as `merchant@banka.sbp` and a dataspace-root alias
  such as `merchant@sbp` can both resolve to the same canonical `AccountId`.
- Canonical account registration is always `Account::new(AccountId)` /
  `NewAccount::new(AccountId)`; there is no domain-qualified or domain-materialized
  registration path.
- Domain ownership, alias permissions, and other domain-scoped behaviors live
  in their own state and APIs rather than on the account identity itself.
- Public account lookup follows that split: alias queries stay public, while
  canonical account identity remains a pure `AccountId`.

Implementation rule for operators, SDKs, and tests: start from the canonical
`AccountId`, then add alias leases, dataspace/domain permissions, and any
domain-owned state separately. Do not synthesize a fake alias-derived account
or expect any linked-domain field on account records just because an alias or
route carries a domain segment.

Current Torii routes:

| Route | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `GET /v1/ram-lfe/program-policies` | Lists active and inactive RAM-LFE program policies plus their public execution metadata, including optional BFV `input_encryption` parameters and the programmed-backend `ram_fhe_profile`. |
| `POST /v1/ram-lfe/programs/{program_id}/execute` | Accepts exactly one of `{ input_hex }` or `{ encrypted_input }` and returns the stateless `RamLfeExecutionReceipt` plus `{ output_hex, output_hash, receipt_hash }` for the selected program. The current Torii runtime issues receipts for the programmed BFV backend. |
| `POST /v1/ram-lfe/receipts/verify` | Statelessly validates a `RamLfeExecutionReceipt` against the published on-chain program policy and optionally checks that a caller-supplied `output_hex` matches the receipt `output_hash`. |
| `GET /v1/identifier-policies` | Lists active and inactive hidden-function policy namespaces plus their public metadata, including optional BFV `input_encryption` parameters, the required `normalization` mode for encrypted client-side input, and `ram_fhe_profile` for programmed BFV policies. |
| `POST /v1/accounts/{account_id}/identifiers/claim-receipt` | Accepts exactly one of `{ input }` or `{ encrypted_input }`. Plaintext `input` is normalized server-side; BFV `encrypted_input` must already be normalized according to the published policy mode. The endpoint then derives the `opaque:` handle and returns a signed receipt that `ClaimIdentifier` can submit on-chain, including both the raw `signature_payload_hex` and the parsed `signature_payload`. |
| `POST /v1/identifiers/resolve` | Accepts exactly one of `{ input }` or `{ encrypted_input }`. Plaintext `input` is normalized server-side; BFV `encrypted_input` must already be normalized according to the published policy mode. The endpoint resolves the identifier into `{ opaque_id, receipt_hash, uaid, account_id, signature }` when an active claim exists, and also returns the canonical signed payload as `{ signature_payload_hex, signature_payload }`. |
| `GET /v1/identifiers/receipts/{receipt_hash}` | Looks up the persisted `IdentifierClaimRecord` bound to a deterministic receipt hash so operators and SDKs can audit claim ownership or diagnose replay / mismatch failures without scanning the full identifier index. |

Torii's in-process execution runtime is configured under
`torii.ram_lfe.programs[*]`, keyed by `program_id`. The identifier routes now
reuse that same RAM-LFE runtime instead of a separate `identifier_resolver`
config surface.

Current SDK support:

- `normalizeIdentifierInput(value, normalization)` matches the Rust
  canonicalizers for `exact`, `lowercase_trimmed`, `phone_e164`,
  `email_address`, and `account_number`.
- `ToriiClient.listIdentifierPolicies()` lists policy metadata, including BFV
  input-encryption metadata when the policy publishes it, plus a decoded
  BFV parameter object via `input_encryption_public_parameters_decoded`.
  Programmed policies also expose the decoded `ram_fhe_profile`. That field is
  intentionally BFV-scoped: it lets wallets verify the expected register
  count, lane count, canonicalization mode, and minimum ciphertext modulus for
  the programmed FHE backend before encrypting client-side input.
- `getIdentifierBfvPublicParameters(policy)` and
  `buildIdentifierRequestForPolicy(policy, { input | encryptedInput })` help
  JS callers consume published BFV metadata and build policy-aware request
  bodies without reimplementing policy-id and normalization rules.
- `encryptIdentifierInputForPolicy(policy, input, { seedHex? })` and
  `buildIdentifierRequestForPolicy(policy, { input, encrypt: true })` now let
  JS wallets construct the full BFV Norito ciphertext envelope locally from
  published policy parameters instead of shipping prebuilt ciphertext hex.
- `ToriiClient.resolveIdentifier({ policyId, input | encryptedInput })`
  resolves a hidden identifier and returns the signed receipt payload,
  including `receipt_hash`, `signature_payload_hex`, and
  `signature_payload`.
- `ToriiClient.issueIdentifierClaimReceipt(accountId, { policyId, input |
  encryptedInput })` issues the signed receipt needed by `ClaimIdentifier`.
- `verifyIdentifierResolutionReceipt(receipt, policy)` verifies the returned
  receipt against the policy resolver key on the client side, and
  `ToriiClient.getIdentifierClaimByReceiptHash(receiptHash)` fetches the
  persisted claim record for later audit/debug flows.
- `IrohaSwift.ToriiClient` now exposes `listIdentifierPolicies()`,
  `resolveIdentifier(policyId:input:encryptedInputHex:)`,
  `issueIdentifierClaimReceipt(accountId:policyId:input:encryptedInputHex:)`,
  and `getIdentifierClaimByReceiptHash(_)`, plus
  `ToriiIdentifierNormalization` for the same phone/email/account-number
  canonicalization modes.
- `ToriiIdentifierLookupRequest` and the
  `ToriiIdentifierPolicySummary.plaintextRequest(...)` /
  `.encryptedRequest(...)` helpers provide the typed Swift request surface for
  resolve and claim-receipt calls, and Swift policies can now derive the BFV
  ciphertext locally via `encryptInput(...)` / `encryptedRequest(input:...)`.
- `ToriiIdentifierResolutionReceipt.verifySignature(using:)` validates that
  the top-level receipt fields match the signed payload and verifies the
  resolver signature client-side before submission.
- `HttpClientTransport` in the Android SDK now exposes
  `listIdentifierPolicies()`, `resolveIdentifier(policyId, input,
  encryptedInputHex)`, `issueIdentifierClaimReceipt(accountId, policyId,
  input, encryptedInputHex)`, and `getIdentifierClaimByReceiptHash(...)`,
  plus `IdentifierNormalization` for the same canonicalization rules.
- `IdentifierResolveRequest` and the
  `IdentifierPolicySummary.plaintextRequest(...)` /
  `.encryptedRequest(...)` helpers provide the typed Android request surface,
  while `IdentifierPolicySummary.encryptInput(...)` /
  `.encryptedRequestFromInput(...)` derive the BFV ciphertext envelope
  locally from published policy parameters.
  `IdentifierResolutionReceipt.verifySignature(policy)` verifies the returned
  resolver signature client-side.

Current instruction set:

- `RegisterIdentifierPolicy`
- `ActivateIdentifierPolicy`
- `ClaimIdentifier` (receipt-bound; raw `opaque_id` claims are rejected)
- `RevokeIdentifier`

Three backends now exist in `iroha_crypto::ram_lfe`:

- the historical commitment-bound `HKDF-SHA3-512` PRF, and
- a BFV-backed secret affine evaluator that consumes BFV-encrypted identifier
  slots directly. When `iroha_crypto` is built with the default
  `bfv-accel` feature, BFV ring multiplication uses an exact deterministic
  CRT-NTT backend internally; disabling that feature falls back to the
  scalar schoolbook path with identical outputs, and
- a BFV-backed secret programmed evaluator that derives an instruction-driven
  RAM-style execution trace over encrypted registers and ciphertext memory
  lanes before deriving the opaque identifier and receipt hash. The programmed
  backend now requires a stronger BFV modulus floor than the affine path, and
  its public parameters are published in a canonical bundle that includes the
  RAM-FHE execution profile consumed by wallets and verifiers.

Here BFV means the Brakerski/Fan-Vercauteren FHE scheme implemented in
`crates/iroha_crypto/src/fhe_bfv.rs`. It is the encrypted-execution mechanism
used by the affine and programmed backends, not the name of the outer hidden
function abstraction.

Torii uses the backend published by the policy commitment. When the BFV backend
is active, plaintext requests are normalized then encrypted server-side before
evaluation. BFV `encrypted_input` requests for the affine backend are evaluated
directly and must already be normalized client-side; the programmed backend
canonicalizes encrypted input back onto the resolver's deterministic BFV
envelope before executing the secret RAM program so receipt hashes remain
stable across semantically equivalent ciphertexts.

## 2. Deriving and verifying UAIDs

There are three supported ways to obtain a UAID:

1. **Read it from world state or SDK models.** Any `Account`/`AccountDetails`
   payload queried via Torii now has the `uaid` field populated when the
   participant opted into universal accounts.
2. **Query the UAID registries.** Torii exposes
   `GET /v1/space-directory/uaids/{uaid}` which returns the dataspace bindings
   and manifest metadata the Space Directory host persists (see
   `docs/space-directory.md` §3 for payload samples).
3. **Derive it deterministically.** When bootstrapping new UAIDs offline, hash
   the canonical participant seed with Blake2b-256 and prefix the result with
   `uaid:`. The snippet below mirrors the helper documented in
   `docs/space-directory.md` §3.3:

   ```python
   import hashlib
   seed = b"participant@example"  # canonical address/domain seed
   digest = hashlib.blake2b(seed, digest_size=32).hexdigest()
   print(f"uaid:{digest}")
   ```

Always store the literal in lower case and normalise whitespace before hashing.
CLI helpers such as `iroha app space-directory manifest scaffold` and the Android
`UaidLiteral` parser apply the same trimming rules so governance reviews can
cross-check values without ad hoc scripts.

## 3. Inspecting UAID holdings and manifests

The deterministic portfolio aggregator in `iroha_core::nexus::portfolio`
surfaces every asset/dataspace pair that references the UAID. Operators and SDKs
can consume the data through the following surfaces:

| Surface | Usage |
|---------|-------|
| `GET /v1/accounts/{uaid}/portfolio` | Returns dataspace → asset → balance summaries; described in `docs/source/torii/portfolio_api.md`. |
| `GET /v1/space-directory/uaids/{uaid}` | Lists dataspace IDs + account literals tied to the UAID. |
| `GET /v1/space-directory/uaids/{uaid}/manifests` | Provides the full `AssetPermissionManifest` history for audits. |
| `iroha app space-directory bindings fetch --uaid <literal>` | CLI shortcut that wraps the bindings endpoint and optionally writes the JSON to disk (`--json-out`). |
| `iroha app space-directory manifest fetch --uaid <literal> --json-out <path>` | Fetches the manifest JSON bundle for evidence packs. |

Example CLI session (Torii URL configured via `torii_api_url` in `iroha.json`):

```bash
iroha app space-directory bindings fetch \
  --uaid uaid:86e8ee39a3908460a0f4ee257bb25f340cd5b5de72735e9adefe07d5ef4bb0df \
  --json-out artifacts/uaid86/bindings.json

iroha app space-directory manifest fetch \
  --uaid uaid:86e8ee39a3908460a0f4ee257bb25f340cd5b5de72735e9adefe07d5ef4bb0df \
  --json-out artifacts/uaid86/manifests.json
```

Store the JSON snapshots alongside the manifest hash used during reviews; the
Space Directory watcher rebuilds the `uaid_dataspaces` map whenever manifests
activate, expire, or revoke, so these snapshots are the fastest way to prove
what bindings were active at a given epoch.

## 4. Publishing capability manifests with evidence

Use the CLI flow below whenever a new allowance is rolled out. Each step must
land in the evidence bundle recorded for governance sign-off.

1. **Encode the manifest JSON** so reviewers see the deterministic hash before
   submission:

   ```bash
   iroha app space-directory manifest encode \
     --json fixtures/space_directory/capability/eu_regulator_audit.manifest.json \
     --out artifacts/eu_regulator_audit.manifest.to \
     --hash-out artifacts/eu_regulator_audit.manifest.hash
   ```

2. **Publish the allowance** using either the Norito payload (`--manifest`) or
   the JSON description (`--manifest-json`). Record the Torii/CLI receipt plus
   the `PublishSpaceDirectoryManifest` instruction hash:

   ```bash
   iroha app space-directory manifest publish \
     --manifest artifacts/eu_regulator_audit.manifest.to \
     --reason "ESMA wave 2 onboarding"
   ```

3. **Capture SpaceDirectoryEvent evidence.** Subscribe to
   `SpaceDirectoryEvent::ManifestActivated` and include the event payload in
   the bundle so auditors can confirm when the change landed.

4. **Generate an audit bundle** tying the manifest to its dataspace profile and
   telemetry hooks:

   ```bash
   iroha app space-directory manifest audit-bundle \
     --manifest artifacts/eu_regulator_audit.manifest.to \
     --profile fixtures/space_directory/profile/cbdc_lane_profile.json \
     --out-dir artifacts/eu_regulator_audit_bundle
   ```

5. **Verify bindings via Torii** (`bindings fetch` and `manifests fetch`) and
   archive those JSON files with the hash + bundle above.

Evidence checklist:

- [ ] Manifest hash (`*.manifest.hash`) signed by the change approver.
- [ ] CLI/Torii receipt for the publish call (stdout or `--json-out` artefact).
- [ ] `SpaceDirectoryEvent` payload proving activation.
- [ ] Audit bundle directory with dataspace profile, hooks, and manifest copy.
- [ ] Bindings + manifest snapshots fetched from Torii post-activation.

This mirrors the requirements in `docs/space-directory.md` §3.2 while giving SDK
owners a single page to point to during release reviews.

## 5. Regulator/regional manifest templates

Use the in-repo fixtures as starting points when crafting capability manifests
for regulators or regional supervisors. They demonstrate how to scope allow/deny
rules and explain the policy notes reviewers expect.

| Fixture | Purpose | Highlights |
|---------|---------|------------|
| `fixtures/space_directory/capability/eu_regulator_audit.manifest.json` | ESMA/ESRB audit feed. | Read-only allowances for `compliance.audit::{stream_reports, request_snapshot}` with deny-wins on retail transfers to keep regulator UAIDs passive. |
| `fixtures/space_directory/capability/jp_regulator_supervision.manifest.json` | JFSA supervision lane. | Adds a capped `cbdc.supervision.issue_stop_order` allowance (PerDay window + `max_amount`) and an explicit deny on `force_liquidation` to enforce dual controls. |

When cloning these fixtures, update:

1. `uaid` and `dataspace` ids to match the participant and lane you’re enabling.
2. `activation_epoch`/`expiry_epoch` windows based on the governance schedule.
3. `notes` fields with the regulator’s policy references (MiCA article, JFSA
   circular, etc.).
4. Allowance windows (`PerSlot`, `PerMinute`, `PerDay`) and optional
   `max_amount` caps so SDKs enforce the same limits as the host.

## 6. Migration notes for SDK consumers

Existing SDK integrations that referenced per-domain account IDs must migrate to
the UAID-centric surfaces described above. Use this checklist during upgrades:

  account ids. For Rust/JS/Swift/Android this means upgrading to the latest
  workspace crates or regenerating Norito bindings.
- **API calls:** Replace domain-scoped portfolio queries with
  `GET /v1/accounts/{uaid}/portfolio` and the manifest/bindings endpoints.
  `GET /v1/accounts/{uaid}/portfolio` accepts an optional `asset_id` query
  parameter when wallets only need a single asset instance. Client helpers such
  as `ToriiClient.getUaidPortfolio` (JS) and the Android
  `SpaceDirectoryClient` already wrap these routes; prefer them over bespoke
  HTTP code.
- **Caching & telemetry:** Cache entries by UAID + dataspace instead of raw
  account ids, and emit telemetry showing the UAID literal so operations can
  line up logs with Space Directory evidence.
- **Error handling:** New endpoints return the strict UAID parsing errors
  documented in `docs/source/torii/portfolio_api.md`; surface those codes
  verbatim so support teams can triage issues without repro steps.
- **Testing:** Wire the fixtures mentioned above (plus your own UAID manifests)
  into SDK test suites to prove Norito round-trips and manifest evaluations
  match the host implementation.

# Snapshot Query Operations

Snapshot queries execute against a consistent `StateView` so operators can service
read-only workloads without affecting consensus state. This note collects the
operational guardrails that now ship with the snapshot lane.

## Resource Budgets and Quotas

- `pipeline.query_stored_min_gas_units` gates server-side cursor storage. When
  the value is greater than zero:
  - `Start` requests that opt into stored mode must provide at least this many
    `gas_units` via the Torii query-string override.
  - `Continue` requests must echo a budget in the Norito payload via
    `ForwardCursor.gas_budget`. Budgets lower than the configured minimum are
    rejected with a `NotPermitted` validation error.
- `live_query_store.capacity` limits the total number of stored cursors.
- `live_query_store.capacity_per_user` enforces per-authority quotas. When the
  quota is exceeded the server returns the `AuthorityQuotaExceeded` error.

## Cursor TTL and Garbage Collection

Stored cursors inherit `live_query_store.idle_time`. A background pruning task
removes cursors whose `last_access_time` exceeds this TTL. Subsequent `Continue`
requests for evicted cursors surface `QueryExecutionFail::Expired` so clients can
recover gracefully.

## Telemetry

Two families of metrics are exposed when telemetry is enabled:

- Torii front-end metrics:
  - `torii_query_snapshot_requests_total{mode}` – request counter.
  - `torii_query_snapshot_first_batch_ms{mode}` – first-batch latency histogram.
  - `torii_query_snapshot_gas_consumed_units_total{mode}` – cumulative gas budget
    values provided by clients (query-string or cursor payloads).
- Core snapshot lane metrics:
  - `query_snapshot_lane_first_batch_ms{mode}` – execution time inside the lane.
  - `query_snapshot_lane_first_batch_items{mode}` – item counts per batch.
  - `query_snapshot_lane_remaining_items{mode}` – remaining items gauge.
  - `query_snapshot_lane_cursors_total{mode}` – stored cursor issuance counter.

All counters are labeled by cursor mode (`ephemeral` or `stored`) so operators can
track adoption and verify budget compliance.

## Operator Checklist

1. Tune `pipeline.query_default_cursor_mode` to select ephemeral vs stored mode
   for the default case.
2. When enabling stored cursors, provision `pipeline.query_stored_min_gas_units`
   and monitor `torii_query_snapshot_gas_consumed_units_total` to ensure clients
   honour budgets.
3. Size `live_query_store.capacity` and `capacity_per_user` according to expected
   workloads, watching `query_snapshot_lane_cursors_total` to understand how many
   cursors are being issued.
4. Review `query_snapshot_lane_remaining_items` to detect long-lived cursors and
   adjust `idle_time` if pruning becomes too aggressive or too lax.

These guardrails keep snapshot queries predictable while providing visibility
into operator-facing resource usage.

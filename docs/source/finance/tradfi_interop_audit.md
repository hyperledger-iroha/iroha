# TradFi ISO 20022 Interop Audit

This audit describes the repository-level ISO 20022 and TradFi interoperability
surface. It is a design and implementation map for broad interop readiness; it
does not claim direct live SWIFT, Fedwire, SEPA, or CSD network connectivity.

## Standards Baseline

- ISO 20022 message definitions, MDRs, schemas, examples, Business Application
  Header material, external code sets, and SupplementaryData material remain the
  canonical source of truth for message layout and versioning.[^iso_catalogue]
- Swift CBPR+ is now ISO 20022-first: Swift reports that the MT and ISO 20022
  coexistence period for cross-border payments and reporting ended on
  2025-11-22, after which ISO 20022 is required for payment instructions on that
  rail.[^swift_cbpr]
- Fedwire Funds completed its ISO 20022 migration on 2025-07-15, so any Fedwire
  profile must be strict about the selected message version, business service,
  participant identifiers, and USD minor units.[^fedwire_iso]
- CPMI harmonisation guidance is maintained through at least end-2027; the bridge
  should treat those requirements as profile input for cross-border payment
  data quality, not as a runtime network connection.[^cpmi_harmonisation]

## Current Repository Surface

- `ivm::iso20022` contains deterministic parsers and static schemas for payment,
  securities, cash-management, and collateral message families.
- Torii exposes `pacs.008` and `pacs.009` ingestion plus status retrieval. The
  bridge builds signed transfer transactions from configured account aliases,
  currency bindings, and reference-data snapshots.
- The JavaScript SDK contains builders for `pacs.*` and `camt.*` payloads and
  client helpers for Torii ISO submissions and polling.
- The CLI can emit `sese.023` and `sese.025` settlement previews for DvP/PvP
  flows, with optional reference-data validation for delivery instrument IDs.
- Reference-data loaders ingest ISIN/CUSIP, BIC/LEI, and MIC snapshots from
  operator-provided files. No runtime remote fetch is performed.

## Implemented In This Pass

- Added a shared static profile catalog in `iroha_core::iso_bridge::profiles`
  for:
  - `generic-iso20022`
  - `swift-cbpr-plus`
  - `fedwire-funds`
  - `sepa-sct-inst`
  - `securities-csd`
- Extended `iso_bridge` config with:
  - `default_profile`
  - `profiles`
  - `store_dir`
  - `embedded_signature_policy`
  - per-profile required reference datasets and message profiles
- Made Torii inbound validation profile-aware for existing `pacs.008` and
  `pacs.009` endpoints:
  - profile selected by `X-Iroha-Iso-Profile`, then `?profile=...`, then config
    default
  - message definition version and business service checks
  - Business Application Header checks for live profiles
  - UETR capture and replay detection
  - profile-required reference-data gates
  - amount minor-unit checks
  - structured address and SupplementaryData limits
  - embedded XMLDSig/XAdES markers recorded for generic ISO, rejected for live
    profiles that do not enable verification, and accepted for
    `require-verified` profiles only after P-256/SHA-256 verification plus
    profile-specific public-key, leaf-certificate, or linked certificate-chain
    SHA-256 pin matching with uncompressed P-256 SEC1 raw public-key
    validation, leaf `digitalSignature`, and issuer critical
    CA `basicConstraints`/`keyCertSign` policy checks, certificate-chain
    ECDSA-with-SHA256/secp256r1 plus uncompressed P-256 SEC1 SPKI enforcement,
    child issuer distinguished-name binding to parent subject distinguished
    names, issuer path-length constraint enforcement, unsupported-critical-extension
    rejection, and validity-at-signing checks using verified signed XAdES
    `SigningTime` or BAH `CreDt`. Unsigned
    signature-local `SigningTime` values are not trusted. ECDSA `SignatureValue`
    accepts fixed-width P-256 `r || s` and DER encodings only when `s` is
    canonical low-S.
    Reference URIs are limited to one empty URI or one unique same-document `#id`
    target that strictly encloses the verified signature carrier, with an
    enveloped-signature transform first, at most one final
    supported C14N transform that controls digest canonicalization, and SHA-256
    digest method. One optional XAdES `SignedProperties` Reference may target a
    local `#id` with the XAdES `SignedProperties` Type URI, exactly one supported
    C14N transform, and a SHA-256 digest; its enclosing `QualifyingProperties`
    target must bind to the enclosing `Signature` `Id`. Certificate-backed XAdES
    signatures must present a non-empty, duplicate-free ordered prefix of the
    verified XMLDSig certificate-chain SHA-256 digests, starting with the leaf
    certificate. The supported signed-property subset requires direct
    `Signature/Object/QualifyingProperties/SignedProperties/SignedSignatureProperties`
    structure; `QualifyingProperties` accepts only `Target`,
    `SigningCertificateV2` accepts only attribute-free direct `Cert` children
    with attribute-free direct `CertDigest` children, a `DigestMethod` carrying
    only `Algorithm`, and text-only digest values; signed `SigningTime` is a
    singleton attribute-free text leaf. Prefixed XAdES structural elements must
    resolve to the ETSI XAdES v1.3.2 namespace, and unprefixed XMLDSig/XAdES
    structural elements reject explicit conflicting default namespaces. Any
    `SignedProperties` element under the signature must be the verified
    referenced direct target; unreferenced, wrapped, or duplicate
    `SignedProperties` elements fail closed.
    Same-document targets carry ancestor namespace
    declarations into root canonicalization, constrained to a fail-closed
    supported canonical XML subset for empty-element expansion, attribute quote normalization, namespace
    declarations plus unprefixed, declared prefixed, and implicit `xml:`
    attribute sorting, legal `xmlns:xml` declaration omission, and
    predefined/numeric XML character-reference decoding.
    Supported XMLDSig method and transform elements are parameter-free and reject
    non-whitespace child content such as `InclusiveNamespaces`, XPath, HMAC, or
    digest parameters. Method, transform, digest, and Reference policy
    attributes are read by exact XML attribute name only, so namespace-qualified
    spoof attributes fail closed. Critical method elements must appear exactly once, and
    Reference transforms must be enclosed in exactly one attribute-free
    `Transforms` wrapper; only implemented ordinary attributes are accepted
    (`Algorithm`, payload Reference `URI`, and XAdES Reference `URI`/`Type`).
    Extra direct children under `Reference` or `Transforms` fail closed, and
    supported References must keep direct children ordered as `Transforms`,
    `DigestMethod`, then `DigestValue`.
    Top-level `Signature` and `SignedInfo` parsing accepts only implemented
    direct children in supported XMLDSig order, so reordered or wrapped
    `SignedInfo` or method nodes, unsupported direct children, and duplicate
    singleton signature nodes fail closed. The payload may contain exactly one
    supported signature carrier: either a bare XMLDSig `Signature` or an ISO
    `Sgntr` wrapper with exactly one direct XMLDSig `Signature` child. Any
    additional `Signature`/`Sgntr` element outside the verified carrier fails closed.
    Prefixed XMLDSig structural elements
    must resolve to the XMLDSig namespace in their inherited scope across
    `Signature`, `SignedInfo`, Reference transforms/digests, and public-key or
    X.509 `KeyInfo` material. Supported XML element spans require exact
    qualified-name matches between opening and closing tags.
    Required XMLDSig base64 fields reject duplicates and must be attribute-free
    text leaves without nested markup or comments, and `PublicKey`/
    `X509Certificate` credential leaves follow the same no-markup rule.
    Public-key material cannot be mixed with `X509Certificate` material in one `KeyInfo`; key
    material must be scoped to exactly one structured `KeyInfo` using either
    `KeyValue/ECKeyValue` with P-256 `NamedCurve` or one `X509Data` wrapper,
    with unsupported direct child elements, unsupported ordinary attributes, and
    non-whitespace wrapper text rejected.
    Valid XML comments are omitted for the supported no-comments C14N algorithms.
    Root namespace declarations inherited from the enclosing `Signature` are
    applied by C14N mode: all inherited root declarations for inclusive C14N and
    only visibly used inherited root declarations for exclusive C14N.
    `revoked_certificate_sha256` pins deny otherwise trusted chains
- Added durable ISO bridge state under `store_dir/messages/*.json`, including
  payload hash, profile metadata, UETR, transaction hash, status history, reason
  codes, context, and reference snapshot id.
- Added richer JSON status fields to existing responses and exposed
  `/v1/iso20022/messages/{msg_id}` as an alias for message records.
- Added `/v1/iso20022/messages/{msg_id}/pacs002` to emit a current `pacs.002`
  status report XML from the same status record.
- Updated OpenAPI and MCP submission surfaces to expose profile selection.
- Made JS `submitIsoMessage` require an explicit `creationDateTime`; the helper
  no longer injects wall-clock time.
- Added `profile` support to JS ISO submissions and extended response
  normalization for profile/status-history fields.
- Added explicit `--iso-settlement-date YYYY-MM-DD` to CLI ISO settlement
  previews so generated `sese.023`/`sese.025` XML can be deterministic.

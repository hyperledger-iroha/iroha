# Bridge proofs

Bridge proof submissions travel through the standard instruction path (`SubmitBridgeProof`) and land in the proof registry with a verified status. The current surface covers ICS-style Merkle proofs and transparent-ZK payloads with pinned retention and manifest binding.

## Acceptance rules

- Ranges must be ordered/non-empty and respect `zk.bridge_proof_max_range_len` (0 disables the cap).
- Optional height windows reject stale/future proofs: `zk.bridge_proof_max_past_age_blocks` and `zk.bridge_proof_max_future_drift_blocks` are measured against the block height that ingests the proof (0 disables the guardrails).
- Bridge proofs may not overlap an existing proof for the same backend (pinned proofs are preserved and block overlaps).
- Manifest hashes must be non-zero; payloads are size-capped by `zk.max_proof_size_bytes`.
- ICS payloads honour the configured Merkle depth cap and verify the path using the declared hash function; transparent payloads must declare a non-empty backend label.
- Pinned proofs are exempt from retention pruning; unpinned proofs still respect the global `zk.proof_history_cap`/grace/batch settings.

## Torii API surface

- `GET /v1/zk/proofs` and `GET /v1/zk/proofs/count` accept bridge-aware filters:
  - `bridge_only=true` returns only bridge proofs.
  - `bridge_pinned_only=true` narrows to pinned bridge proofs.
  - `bridge_start_from_height` / `bridge_end_until_height` clamp the bridge range window.
- `GET /v1/zk/proof/{backend}/{hash}` returns bridge metadata (range, manifest hash, payload summary) alongside the proof id/status/VK bindings.
- The full Norito proof record (including payload bytes) remains available via `GET /v1/proofs/{proof_id}` for off-node verifiers.

## Bridge receipt events

Bridge lanes emit typed receipts via the `RecordBridgeReceipt` instruction. Executing this instruction
records a `BridgeReceipt` payload and emits `DataEvent::Bridge(BridgeEvent::Emitted)` on the event
stream, replacing the prior log-only stub. The CLI `iroha bridge emit-receipt` helper submits the
typed instruction so indexers can consume receipts deterministically.

## External verification sketch (ICS)

```rust
use iroha_data_model::bridge::{BridgeHashFunction, BridgeProofPayload, BridgeProofRecord};
use iroha_crypto::{Hash, HashOf, MerkleTree};

fn verify_ics(record: &BridgeProofRecord) -> bool {
    let BridgeProofPayload::Ics(ics) = &record.proof.payload else {
        return false;
    };
    let leaf = HashOf::<[u8; 32]>::from_untyped_unchecked(Hash::prehashed(ics.leaf_hash));
    let root =
        HashOf::<MerkleTree<[u8; 32]>>::from_untyped_unchecked(Hash::prehashed(ics.state_root));
    match ics.hash_function {
        BridgeHashFunction::Sha256 => ics.proof.clone().verify_sha256(&leaf, &root, ics.proof.audit_path().len()),
        BridgeHashFunction::Blake2b => ics.proof.clone().verify(&leaf, &root, ics.proof.audit_path().len()),
    }
}
```

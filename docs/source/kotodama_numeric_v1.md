# Kotodama exact numerics and declaration grammar (ABI V1)

This document is normative for the first Kotodama/IVM release. The keywords
`MUST`, `MUST NOT`, `SHOULD`, and `MAY` have their usual standards meaning.
There is no compatibility contract for the pre-release declaration grammar,
numeric types, pointer layouts, or numeric syscalls described as retired
below.

## Source-language surface

Kotodama uses type-first declarations consistently:

```kotodama
seiyaku Counter {
    const int initial = 1;
    const int step = 2;

    state int value;

    hajimari() {
        value = initial;
    }

    kotoage fn increment() authorize("CanIncrement") {
        value = value + step;
    }

    view fn current() -> int {
        return value;
    }
}
```

The same order applies to local variables and parameters:

```text
let int count = 0;
fn add(int lhs, int rhs) -> int { return lhs + rhs; }
```

The old `name: Type` declaration form is invalid. The source type names `i64`,
`u128`, `Amount`, `num`, `number`, `float`, and `money`, and suffixed numeric literals such as
`1i64`, `1u128`, and `1amt`, are invalid. Diagnostics MUST identify the retired
surface and show the type-first replacement.

V1 exposes three numeric types:

- `int`: a bounded signed integer with adaptive encoded width;
- `decimal`: a bounded exact base-10 value, not IEEE-754 floating point;
- `quantity`: a nominal, canonical, non-negative asset quantity.

The language does not define a primitive `money` type. Iroha assets may model
commodities, votes, rights, or money, so calling every balance “money” would be
incorrect. Applications MAY define nominal monetary types and policies over
`quantity`.

An unsuffixed whole-number literal has type `int` when no expected type exists.
It may be checked contextually as `decimal` or `quantity`; a contextual
`quantity` literal MUST be non-negative. A literal containing a decimal point
or decimal exponent has type `decimal` unless a `quantity` is expected.
Literal conversion is exact and occurs at compile time.
The expected numeric domain propagates into exact literal arithmetic and into
tuple, struct, list, return, argument, and constant-initializer positions.
This rule changes only exact literal expressions: it never implicitly converts
an existing runtime `int`, `decimal`, or `quantity` value to another nominal
domain.
Literal mantissa and scale are normalized before the canonical scale bound is
checked. Thus a spelling with more than 28 fractional places is accepted only
when removing trailing decimal zeroes reduces its canonical scale to at most
28.

Integer literals MAY use decimal, `0x` hexadecimal, or `0b` binary spelling.
Decimal literals MAY use exact exponent notation. Digit separators are allowed
only between digits. `1.`, `.5`, repeated separators, and missing exponent
digits are invalid. Parsing MUST treat a leading sign and the following literal
as one range-checking operation so `-2^511` is accepted.

## Value domains

### `int`

An `int` is an integer `m` in the closed range:

```text
-2^511 <= m <= 2^511 - 1
```

This is a signed 512-bit two's-complement domain. “512-bit” never means a sign
plus a 512-bit magnitude.

### `decimal`

A `decimal` represents the mathematical value `m * 10^-s`, where:

```text
-2^511 <= m <= 2^511 - 1
0 <= s <= 28
```

Every value has exactly one canonical representation:

1. `(0, s)` normalizes to `(0, 0)`.
2. While `s > 0` and `m` is divisible by ten, replace `(m, s)` with
   `(m / 10, s - 1)`.

Canonicalization discards source-level significant-zero intent. Consequently
`1`, `1.0`, and `1.00` are the same numeric value and encode identically. A
separate application type is required when declared precision is part of the
business meaning.

### `quantity`

A `quantity` has the same canonical representation and scale bound as
`decimal`, with the additional invariant `m >= 0`. It is a distinct nominal
type. There is no implicit conversion from an arbitrary `decimal` or `int` to
`quantity`.

## Arithmetic semantics

Checked arithmetic computes the exact mathematical result using conceptually
unbounded intermediates, canonicalizes the result, and only then checks the
final V1 domain. An implementation's host bigint width, allocation strategy,
or temporary representation MUST NOT affect success, failure, or output.

After canonicalization, result-domain failures are checked in this stable
order: canonical scale, signed mantissa width, then the nominal non-negative
`quantity` invariant. Thus simultaneous scale and mantissa failure reports
`ScaleOverflow`, and a negative result whose magnitude is also out of range
reports `MantissaOverflow`. `quantity - quantity` maps a representable negative
mathematical result to `QuantityUnderflow`.

The following tables are the complete ordinary numeric operator surface. An
em dash means that the combination is a compile-time error; operators are not
commutatively inferred, so an allowed `quantity * decimal` row does not create
a `decimal * quantity` row.

| Operand | Unary `-` result | Semantics |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `int` | `int` | exact checked negation; negating `-2^511` overflows |
| `decimal` | `decimal` | exact negation, canonicalize, then check the final domain |
| `quantity` | — | a non-negative nominal value has no ordinary negation |

| Left | Right | `+` | `-` | `*` | `/` | `%` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `int` | `int` | `int` | `int` | `int` | `int` | `int` |
| `int` | `decimal` | `decimal` | `decimal` | `decimal` | `decimal` | — |
| `int` | `quantity` | — | — | — | — | — |
| `decimal` | `int` | `decimal` | `decimal` | `decimal` | `decimal` | — |
| `decimal` | `decimal` | `decimal` | `decimal` | `decimal` | `decimal` | — |
| `decimal` | `quantity` | — | — | — | — | — |
| `quantity` | `int` | — | — | — | — | — |
| `quantity` | `decimal` | — | — | `quantity` | `quantity` | — |
| `quantity` | `quantity` | `quantity` | `quantity` | — | `decimal` | — |

All allowed arithmetic is exact and checked. `int / int` truncates toward
zero and `int % int` is its paired remainder. Mixed `int`/`decimal` rows
promote the `int` exactly before operating. Decimal division accepts only a
canonical exact result representable with scale in `0..=28`. Quantity
addition remains non-negative by construction; quantity subtraction reports
`QuantityUnderflow` for a representable negative result. Multiplication or
division of a quantity by a decimal preserves the nominal quantity domain and
therefore rejects a negative result. Dividing quantity by quantity produces
an exact dimensionless decimal ratio. No ordinary numeric `%` exists outside
`int % int`.

Each of `==`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, and `>=` has this complete matrix:

| Left | `int` right | `decimal` right | `quantity` right |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `int` | `bool` | `bool` | — |
| `decimal` | `bool` | `bool` | — |
| `quantity` | — | — | `bool` |

Comparison is over mathematical values after canonicalization. Mixed
`int`/`decimal` comparison promotes `int` exactly. `quantity` compares only
with `quantity`; crossing its nominal boundary requires a named conversion.
These unary, arithmetic, and comparison tables comprise 102 ordered rows (54
allowed and 48 rejected) in numeric-semantics descriptor version 2.

Compound assignment applies the same operator matrix and then requires the
result to remain assignable to the target's declared type. In particular,
`decimal += int` promotes the right operand exactly and is valid, while
`int += decimal` is rejected because it would narrow a decimal result back to
`int` implicitly. `quantity` retains its nominal operator rows.

For `quantity / <whole-number literal>`, the expected result resolves the two
valid rows without adding a runtime conversion. An expected `quantity` (or no
expected type) checks the divisor as `decimal`; an expected `decimal` checks it
as `quantity`, producing a dimensionless ratio. For example,
`fn half(quantity q) -> quantity { q / 2 }` and
`fn ratio(quantity q) -> decimal { q / 2 }` are both exact and have the stated
result types. A non-literal divisor is never retagged this way.

For integer division, with nonzero `b`:

```text
q = trunc(a / b)
a = q * b + r
abs(r) < abs(b)
r has the sign of a unless r = 0
```

`min_int / -1` and `min_int % -1` fail with mantissa overflow because the
paired quotient is not representable. Division by zero has its own fault.

Decimal multiplication forms the exact product at the sum of input scales,
normalizes it, and rejects only when the canonical final scale remains above
28 or its final mantissa is out of range. It never rounds implicitly.

Exact division first reduces and classifies the denominator. A representable
quotient performs exactly one division at its proven minimum scale. A failure
performs no speculative output-scale attempts and distinguishes:

- `RepeatingDecimal`: the reduced denominator contains a prime factor other
  than two or five;
- `ExactDivisionScaleOverflow`: the expansion terminates but needs a canonical
  scale above 28.

For nonzero `b`, exact decimal division is normatively equivalent to this
pseudocode. Every integer in the pseudocode is conceptual and unbounded until
the final-domain check:

```text
exact_divide((ma, sa), (mb, sb)):
    if mb == 0: fail DivisionByZero
    if ma == 0: return (0, 0)

    n = ma * 10^sb
    d = mb * 10^sa
    if d < 0: n = -n; d = -d
    g = gcd(abs(n), d)
    n = n / g
    d = d / g

    twos = 0
    while d % 2 == 0: d = d / 2; twos += 1
    fives = 0
    while d % 5 == 0: d = d / 5; fives += 1
    if d != 1: fail RepeatingDecimal

    scale = max(twos, fives)
    if scale > 28: fail ExactDivisionScaleOverflow
    mantissa = n * 2^(scale - twos) * 5^(scale - fives)
    result = canonicalize(mantissa, scale)
    check final scale, signed mantissa, then nominal quantity domain
    return result
```

The zero special case is canonical without a GCD, factor-classification, or
normalization division. Classification uses exact Euclidean quotient/remainder
steps and repeated exact division by two and five; a host bigint library's GCD
or radix-specific shortcut is not a different observable algorithm.

Rounded division requires an output scale and one of these stable modes:

```text
decimal.div_round(decimal divisor, int scale, rounding-mode mode) -> decimal
quantity.div_round(decimal divisor, int scale, rounding-mode mode) -> quantity
quantity.ratio_round(quantity divisor, int scale, rounding-mode mode) -> decimal
```

All three methods require the three argument names shown above. `rounding-mode`
denotes one of the seven `Rounding::*` paths below, not a user-declarable type
or an integer tag. `scale` is
checked against `0..=28`; a constant outside that range is rejected with
`E_INVALID_SCALE`, and a dynamic value is checked by the numeric syscall before
arithmetic. `div_round` is not defined on `int`, and `ratio_round` is defined
only on `quantity`. The result domain is fixed by the signature and never
inferred from assignment context.

| Tag | Mode | Meaning |
| ---: | --- | --- |
| 0 | `Rounding::toward_zero` | toward zero |
| 1 | `Rounding::away_from_zero` | away from zero |
| 2 | `Rounding::floor` | toward negative infinity |
| 3 | `Rounding::ceil` | toward positive infinity |
| 4 | `Rounding::nearest_even` | nearest, ties to an even mantissa |
| 5 | `Rounding::nearest_away` | nearest, ties away from zero |
| 6 | `Rounding::nearest_toward_zero` | nearest, ties toward zero |

The tag is the stable numeric ABI tag emitted by the compiler; source does not
expose raw numeric rounding tags. Any spelling outside this table is rejected
with `E_NUMERIC_ROUNDING_MODE`.

Rounded decimal division is normatively equivalent to:

```text
rounded_divide((ma, sa), (mb, sb), output_scale, mode):
    require 0 <= output_scale <= 28
    if mb == 0: fail DivisionByZero
    n = ma * 10^(sb + output_scale)
    d = mb * 10^sa
    q, r = truncating_div_rem(n, d)
    if r != 0:
        adjust q by at most one unit according to mode, sign(n / d),
        comparison(2 * abs(r), abs(d)), and q parity for nearest_even
    result = canonicalize(q, output_scale)
    check final scale, signed mantissa, then nominal quantity domain
    return result
```

`toward_zero` never adjusts; `away_from_zero` always adjusts a nonzero
remainder away from zero; `floor` adjusts only a negative result; `ceil`
adjusts only a positive result. The three nearest modes adjust when
`2*abs(r) > abs(d)` and apply their documented tie rule when equal. All modes
use the same charged conservative work bound.

The source conversion surface is explicit and complete:

| Operation | Result | Normative behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `decimal::from_int(value)` | `decimal` | exact `(value, 0)`; cannot lose range or precision |
| `decimal::to_int_exact(value)` | `int` | succeeds only when the mathematical value is integral; otherwise `InexactConversion` |
| `decimal::to_int_trunc(value)` | `int` | discards the fractional part toward zero |
| `decimal::to_int_round(value, mode)` | `int` | rounds to scale zero using exactly one of the seven modes above |
| `quantity::try_from_int(value)` | `Result<quantity, int>` | exact scale-zero conversion; a negative input returns the stable numeric fault tag |
| `quantity::try_from_decimal(value)` | `Result<quantity, int>` | preserves the exact canonical value; a negative input returns the stable numeric fault tag |
| `decimal::from_quantity(value)` | `decimal` | exact nominal-domain exit with identical mantissa and scale |

The `int` error payload of a recoverable quantity conversion is the stable
numeric fault tag; it is not a substituted value. Exact and truncating
decimal-to-int forms and all infallible conversions trap on an impossible
final-domain violation rather than saturating. Width-specific constructors,
implicit assignment/argument/return conversions, and generic `numeric::*`
arithmetic helpers are not part of V1.

Checked negation, addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and
remainder fail rather than wrap. The explicit integer wrapping operations use
modulo `2^512` and reinterpret the result in the signed domain. V1 does not
inherit an `i64` or `u128` modulus from retired source types.

```text
math::wrapping_neg(int value) -> int
math::wrapping_add(int left, int right) -> int
math::wrapping_sub(int left, int right) -> int
math::wrapping_mul(int left, int right) -> int
```

The binary forms require the `left` and `right` argument names. These four
spellings are the complete V1 wrapping surface; flat `wrapping_*` aliases and
generic `numeric::*` helpers are not source APIs.

V1 defines no source bitwise or shift operators. A future operation must first
specify its complete 512-bit two's-complement semantics, valid shift counts,
gas, and ABI surface; host-language bigint behavior is never inherited
implicitly.

The scalar IVM helpers formerly surfaced as `math::isqrt`, `math::abs`,
`math::min`, `math::max`, `math::div_ceil`, `math::gcd`, and `math::mean` are
also not source operations in V1. They cannot acquire an implicit 64-bit input
domain merely because the underlying VM has scalar instructions.

## Canonical wire values

Numeric pointer payloads are complete, schema-bound, uncompressed Norito
frames. V1 permits no layout flags and no alignment padding.

The schema names and 16-byte schema hashes are:

| Type | Schema name | Hash (hex) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `int` | `iroha.numeric.IntValueV1` | `07c039457363b9e1d36bbd31d93dec4a` |
| `decimal` | `iroha.numeric.DecimalValueV1` | `ba2ffed52e4d8ee16f17efefe1828524` |
| `quantity` | `iroha.numeric.QuantityValueV1` | `e4769984c81ce0e8b678f2eb06274ee3` |

ABI V1 descriptor format 5 embeds numeric-semantics descriptor version 2. It
binds all three value domains, exact-intermediate and result-validation rules,
the complete operator/conversion/wrapping rules, canonicalization, integer and
decimal division behavior, and the ordered arithmetic and validation failure
stages. It also binds the canonical JSON boundary as decoded JSON strings with
these exact content grammars:

```text
int       0|-?[1-9][0-9]*
decimal   -?(0|[1-9][0-9]*)(\.[0-9]*[1-9])?
quantity  (0|[1-9][0-9]*)(\.[0-9]*[1-9])?
```

The grammar is followed by the type's scale, mantissa, and sign checks. JSON
number tokens, leading plus signs or zeroes, negative zero, exponent spelling,
and removable fractional zeroes are not alternate representations.

The descriptor separately binds wire-format version 1, all three schema names
and hashes, the complete frame and pointer-envelope layout strings, rounding,
failure, arithmetic-fault, and pointer-fault names/tags. Changing any bound
semantic or layout changes the V1 ABI hash; an implementation MUST NOT mutate
behavior while retaining the old hash.

The numeric body begins with a four-byte little-endian unsigned mantissa byte
length, followed by the minimal little-endian two's-complement bytes. Decimal
and quantity bodies append one scale byte. Integer bodies do not carry a scale.

Zero has length zero and no mantissa bytes. An empty mantissa is therefore the
only zero encoding. Redundant `0x00` or `0xff` sign extension is invalid. A
positive value needing a sign-preserving leading byte is valid only when the
complete minimal encoding remains at most 64 bytes.

With the fixed 40-byte canonical Norito V1 header, maximum frame sizes are 108 bytes for
`int` and 109 bytes for `decimal` and `quantity`. The pointer envelope adds a
seven-byte type/version/length header and a 32-byte `iroha_crypto::Hash::new`
digest of the complete frame, for maxima of 147, 148, and 148 bytes
respectively.

### Typed durable-state identity

The same ABI V1 descriptor binds aggregate durable values rather than merely
the `STATE_VALUE_ENCODE` and `STATE_VALUE_DECODE` syscall signatures. The
`StateValueSchemaV1` and `StateValueRecordV1` frames use stable nominal Norito
schema names, and the descriptor contains their schema hashes, the exact
`KOTODAMA_STATE_VALUE_SCHEMA_V1\0` schema-binding domain, every
`StateValueKindV1`, `StateValueNodeV1`, and `StateValueAtomV1` name and explicit
`u32` wire tag, each variant layout, leaf-to-pointer-type mapping, resource
handle marker, preorder/active-payload traversal rules, Option/Result tag
meaning, decoded word-table layout, and every node/word/byte/list cap.

The enum variants carry explicit `#[codec(index = ...)]` discriminants, so a
source reorder cannot silently alter persisted state. Any change to one of
these durable wire identities changes the ABI V1 hash. This is still ABI
version 1: first-release artifacts carrying an earlier hash are rejected at
admission rather than interpreted under new semantics.

The descriptor also binds the literal `CNTR` section marker and framing,
nominal `EmbeddedContractInterfaceV1` and `EmbeddedStateTypeV1` schema names
and hashes, the complete ordered table of all 20 one-byte state-type tags with
canonical sample frames and layouts, the 256-node nesting limit, and the exact
admission rules. A `StateMap` is a top-level durable collection only and cannot
appear inside another state type. Its key must be one of the supported
canonical scalar domains; tuples require at least two elements, structs must
have a canonical nonempty name and canonical unique nonempty fields, and list
capacity is `1..=64`. Admission rejects a CNTR tree that the runtime cannot
reconstruct and validate.

When CNTR metadata is present, `STATE_GET`, `STATE_SET`, `STATE_DEL`,
`STATE_HAS`, and `STATE_LEN` accept only a declared scalar path or a canonical
child of a declared `StateMap`; a bare map base is a collection prefix, not a
value. `STATE_KEYS` and `STATE_COUNT` also accept that bare map base. Before a
write mutates state, and before a present read publishes bytes to the guest,
the host reconstructs the exact schema from CNTR and requires a canonical
`StateValueRecordV1` whose schema hash, active atom stream, pointer types,
pointer hashes, and leaf payloads all match it. Contract execution without its
CNTR section fails closed. Generic non-contract VM tooling without CNTR retains
bounded raw-path/raw-value behavior; it cannot be used as a contract-runtime
fallback.

The digest is the uniform pointer-ABI frame-integrity binding: it proves that
the bounded frame snapshot subsequently decoded is exactly the frame carried
by the envelope. It is not an authorization mechanism. Before work begins, the
VM debits the declared, capped frame bytes for snapshot transport and
`32 + frame_bytes` for supplied-digest handling plus the complete hash
traversal, then decodes only that authenticated snapshot.

Pointer type IDs are:

```text
0x0010  retired Amount (known, permanently disallowed)
0x0011  IntValueV1
0x0012  DecimalValueV1
0x0013  QuantityValueV1
```

Numeric comparison and equality operate on the mathematical value after
canonicalization. A numeric `StateMap` key's identity and hash input are its
canonical encoded bytes, so alternate spellings of one value cannot create
distinct keys. Deterministic `StateMap` iteration uses canonical encoded-key
byte order; that order is not promised to match signed numeric magnitude.
The VM binds map-key construction and iteration to the loaded CNTR declaration:
the base must name exactly one declared `StateMap`, and numeric keys must be
canonical pointer envelopes of that map's nominal `int`, `decimal`, or
`quantity` key type. Missing schemas, malformed or noncanonical frames, and
cross-type envelopes fail closed. Pre-release scalar path syscall `0x54` is
permanently retired and is not part of ABI V1.
SDKs MUST use arbitrary-precision integer or exact-decimal representations and
MUST NOT map these values to JavaScript
`number`, Java/Kotlin `double`, Swift `Double`, or another lossy host type.
Norito JSON and SDK-facing JSON render all three numeric domains as canonical
base-10 strings: `int` has no decimal point, while `decimal` and `quantity`
use the shortest non-exponent spelling implied by their canonical mantissa and
scale. JSON numeric tokens and alternate string spellings are rejected at a
typed numeric boundary.

## Syscalls and failures

ABI V1 contains the unconditional numeric syscall blocks:

```text
0x010100..0x010113  int
0x010120..0x01012f  decimal
0x010140..0x01014f  quantity
```

Typed exact-number JSON getters occupy `0x010160..0x010165`: `int`, `decimal`,
and `quantity`, followed by their direct-pointer variants. They accept only a
canonical base-10 JSON string. A JSON number token, exponent spelling, leading
plus or zero, negative quantity, removable fractional zero, or out-of-domain
string returns `Option::none`; it is never rounded or converted through a host
floating-point type.

The detailed signatures live in `crates/ivm/spec/syscalls.toml`. The retired
pre-release generic-`Numeric` and `Amount` syscall blocks are not in the V1
allowlist. Every host MUST implement the allowed blocks identically or reject
an unknown number with `VMError::UnknownSyscall`.

Stable numeric fault tags are:

```text
1 MantissaOverflow
2 ScaleOverflow
3 DivisionByZero
4 RepeatingDecimal
5 ExactDivisionScaleOverflow
6 InvalidScale
7 InexactConversion
8 NegativeQuantity
9 QuantityUnderflow
10 InvalidRoundingMode
11 InvalidFailureMode
12 ReservedRegisterNonZero
```

Stable numeric pointer-validation fault tags are:

```text
1 InvalidAddress
2 UnknownType
3 TypeNotAllowed
4 WrongType
5 InvalidEnvelopeVersion
6 OversizedLength
7 TruncatedEnvelope
8 PayloadHashMismatch
9 MalformedFrame
10 SchemaMismatch
11 NonCanonical
```

Both fault tables, including names and tags, are inputs to the ABI V1 hash.

Fallible arithmetic accepts failure mode `0` (trap) or `1` (return the fault in
the status register). Conversions documented as recoverable always return a
status. Invalid pointer envelopes, versions, lengths, hashes, schemas, flags,
canonical encodings, scale pointers, rounding tags, failure modes, and required
zero registers have deterministic distinct validation behavior.

## Deterministic gas

Numeric syscalls use staged metering. They never reserve a worst-case quote and
never refund. Each phase is debited immediately before its bounded work begins;
an unaffordable phase performs no work and leaves earlier phase charges
consumed.

The complete formula and stable OOG phase-tag map have gas-formula version 3.
That version is an input to gas-schedule descriptor format 3 under domain
`iroha.ivm.gas-schedule.v3`. The descriptor also encodes every staged phase
name and numeric tag directly, in tag order; the phase table is not represented
only by an indirect formula-version constant. Changing any logical-work
formula, charge-point ordering, phase name, or phase tag MUST increment the
appropriate descriptor/formula version and regenerate the gas-schedule hash
golden.

The version-3 phase tags are `0 Entry`, `1 PointerHeader`,
`2 PointerEnvelope`, `3 PayloadHash`, `4 NoritoDecode`,
`5 CanonicalValidation`, `6 Arithmetic`, `7 Normalization`, and
`8 OutputSerialization`. Every tag names work that a production numeric path
can actually reach; V1 has no reserved or quote-only staged phases.

Every ABI V1 numeric syscall number requires the wide `SYSTEM`/`SCALLX`
instruction. Executing that instruction costs 5 gas before syscall admission
or staged dispatch. That opcode cost is part of total VM gas, but is
deliberately outside the numeric staged-call formula below. Therefore:

```text
total_vm_gas_for_one_numeric_call = 5 + completed_numeric_stage_gas
```

The stage charge unit is exact and uses checked `u64` arithmetic:

| Phase | Charge immediately before work | Repetition |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `Entry` | `16` | once per admitted numeric call |
| `PointerHeader` | `7` | once per pointer operand |
| `PointerEnvelope` | `frame_bytes` | once per pointer operand |
| `PayloadHash` | `32 + frame_bytes` | once per pointer operand |
| `NoritoDecode` | `4 * decode_work(frame_bytes)` | once per pointer operand |
| `CanonicalValidation` | `4 * canonical_work(frame_bytes)`, plus `4 * QR(mantissa_limbs, 1)` when a canonicality probe is required | in operand-register order |
| `Arithmetic` | `4 * event_work` | once before every arithmetic event actually begun |
| `Normalization` | `4 * QR(mantissa_limbs, 1)` | once before each divide-by-ten normalization probe actually begun |
| `OutputSerialization` | `4 * finalization_work(output_limbs)`, then `output_envelope_bytes + 2 * output_frame_bytes` | only when a numeric pointer result is produced |

Here `QR` is `quotient_remainder_work` defined below. Boolean or scalar
results do not acquire a nonexistent pointer-output charge. A trap or
recoverable arithmetic fault has no output charge. The operational state
machine is:

```text
execute_numeric_scallx(call):
    debit 5                         # ordinary VM instruction gas
    staged_debit(Entry, 16)
    validate bounded entry/privacy/register contract
    for pointer operand in register order:
        staged_debit(PointerHeader, 7)
        read header; validate provenance, type, version, and capped length
        staged_debit(PointerEnvelope, frame_bytes)
        staged_debit(PayloadHash, 32 + frame_bytes)
        snapshot bounded tail; authenticate the exact snapshot
        staged_debit(NoritoDecode, 4 * decode_work(frame_bytes))
        structurally validate the frame
        staged_debit(CanonicalValidation, 4 * canonical_work(frame_bytes))
        decode the body; debit any canonicality probe before performing it
    validate scalar controls in the specified precedence order
    for event in the selected exact operation:
        staged_debit(event.phase, 4 * event_work(event))
        perform event
    if a pointer result exists:
        debit its output-length probe
        derive exact bounded frame/envelope lengths
        debit framing, checksum, authentication, and publication bytes
        allocate, write, and publish result registers
```

`staged_debit` first compares the whole phase charge with remaining gas. If it
is unaffordable, it deducts nothing for that phase, reports that phase's stable
tag, and preserves all earlier charges. There is no quote, reservation, or
refund path.

The successful aggregate identity is:

```text
gas = 16
    + canonical input envelope bytes
    + input frame bytes traversed by the authentication hash
    + canonical output envelope bytes
    + 2 * output frame bytes
    + 4 * logical_limb_work
```

The two output-frame traversals cover canonical Norito framing/checksum work
and the outer authentication hash. `logical_limb_work` includes the bounded
output-length probe before exact compact serialization begins.

There is no implicit minimum applied to `logical_limb_work`; operations whose
normative work is zero still pay the entry and envelope charges.

The constants are consensus weights, not host-cycle counts. They are not
considered release-calibrated until the required benchmark evidence is
archived. The
entry weight `16` covers syscall dispatch, staged-context initialization,
bounded validation of at most four control/reserved registers, and completion
bookkeeping. Pointer traversal is excluded because every traversed envelope
byte is charged separately. The limb-work weight `4` budgets one logical
base-`2^64` work cell for operand access, the arithmetic/carry or trial step,
result access, and deterministic loop/control overhead. Multiplication counts
every input-cell product; division and normalization formulas count their
normalization, quotient-trial, remainder, and probe cells explicitly. Thus a
backend cannot make an uncharged algorithmic pass by selecting a different
bigint representation.

Release calibration uses `cargo bench -p ivm --bench gas_calibration`. The
`ivm-numeric-limb-cal` benchmark pins the formula's work denominator in every
benchmark ID for one through eight input limbs, products through sixteen
limbs, division/remainder, scale-28 rounded division, and minimum/maximum
input/output envelope authentication, framing, and canonical decode. A failing
numeric syscall with an invalid zero pointer separately measures the entry,
dispatch/control, and seven-byte pointer-header boundary without performing
payload work. Its calibration denominator is the staged `16 + 7` gas; the
generic five-gas `SCALLX` instruction charge is asserted against the VM's total
consumption but excluded from that denominator, so it cannot hide an
underpriced numeric entry phase. For each supported
baseline hardware tier, maintainers compare median time per declared work cell
against the scalar IVM `ADD` baseline. `ADD` and the VM-based numeric entry
pipeline subtract the measured `EMPTY_HARNESS` cost before normalization;
direct bigint, decimal, and frame-codec benchmarks do not contain that VM
harness and therefore are not adjusted by it. The
rounded-up worst ratio, plus a minimum 25% safety margin, MUST remain no greater
than `4`; bounded dispatch/control overhead MUST remain no greater than `16`
baseline gas units. A failure requires increasing the constants, changing the
gas-formula version/hash, and regenerating gas goldens before release—it MUST
NOT be hidden by a hardware-specific implementation. The first-release
reference-calibration target is Apple M1 Ultra (`Mac13,2`, arm64), Rust 1.93.1;
release records MUST retain the Criterion output alongside the build artifacts
and repeat the run on the slowest supported tier. This specification does not
claim that calibration has completed unless that archived output is present.
The `numeric_v1_calibration.yml` release workflow repeats the gate on the
supported GitHub runner matrix (Linux x86-64, Linux arm64, Apple Silicon, and
Windows x86-64) and captures each exact host/toolchain identity, console
transcript, and complete Criterion directory as a retained build artifact; tag
publication must not proceed without the archived M1 Ultra reference record
and every matrix run passing.
`scripts/check_numeric_v1_calibration.py` applies that harness adjustment,
normalizes every declared work/gas denominator, applies the 25% margin, and
fails the workflow when factor `4` is insufficient.

The fixed entry charge includes bounded register-contract checks (required-zero
registers, failure mode, and rounding tag). It is not followed by hidden fixed
decode, divisor, or control surcharges. Strict numeric-frame validation adds
these explicit logical work units, where `H = 40` is the fixed header size:

```text
decode_work(frame_bytes) = max(1, ceil(frame_bytes / 8))
canonical_work(frame_bytes) = max(1, ceil(max(frame_bytes - H, 0) / 8))
canonicality_probe_work(m, s) = 0, if s = 0
canonicality_probe_work(m, s) = quotient_remainder_work(limbs(m), 1), if s > 0
frame_validation_work = decode_work + canonical_work + canonicality_probe_work
```

`decode_work` covers the complete structural Norito pass, including its CRC
traversal. `canonical_work` covers body decoding, minimal signed encoding, and
decimal/quantity domain checks. A canonical nonzero scaled decimal or quantity
then performs one divisibility-by-ten probe; it is charged with the same
logical quotient/remainder formula used everywhere else immediately before the
probe. Scale-zero values and canonical zero perform no such probe. Frame bytes
are counted once as input-envelope transport and once for authentication-hash
traversal; the logical work units separately account for structural and
canonical decode passes.

The checked core decimal operations also validate their own operands before
arithmetic so callers outside the pointer decoder cannot bypass the canonical
value invariant. Consequently `decimal` negation/arithmetic/division and
decimal-to-int conversion, plus `quantity` arithmetic/division/ratio, emit and
charge one additional canonicality probe for each nonzero-scale operand.
Comparisons and the explicit `int`/`decimal`/`quantity` representation
conversions do not perform this second probe. This is real repeated validation
work, not a transport-byte charge, and it is included in
`logical_limb_work` through the observed primitive work steps.

Logical limbs are 64 bits, so an input has at most eight limbs. Arithmetic
width uses the bit length of the unsigned magnitude, with zero assigned one
limb. A sign-preserving byte in the canonical
two's-complement wire representation affects envelope-byte gas, not arithmetic
limb work. Let `B(d)` be the exact integer bit length of `10^d` and let:

```text
L(b) = max(1, ceil(b / 64))
P(d) = L(B(d))
C(d) = sum(P(k), k = 0..d-1)
S(0, d) = 1
S(b, 0) = L(b), for b > 0
S(b, d) = L(b + B(d)), for b > 0 and d > 0
A(b, 0) = L(b)
A(b, d) = C(d) + L(b) * P(d), for d > 0
```

`B(d)` is pinned as an integer table for `d` in `0..=56`; gas computation never
uses floating-point logarithms. `C(d)` charges deterministic construction of
`10^d` as the sequence `1 * 10`, `10 * 10`, ..., `10^(d-1) * 10`; the
primitive implementation performs that same bounded sequence instead of an
unmetered backend exponentiation. `A(b, 0)` charges the owned temporary that
the implementation materializes even when no decimal scaling is needed.
Comparison charges both alignment
multiplications using `A` plus the largest conservative aligned width from `S`,
all before it materializes aligned operands. Addition and subtraction debit
each alignment multiplication first; once those exact aligned operands exist,
they debit the largest *actual* aligned limb width immediately before the add
or subtract. This actual width is deterministic and no greater than `S`.
Multiplication charges the product of input limb widths.

The apparently tighter `L(b + B(d) - 1)` is not a valid consensus bound. For
example, a 61-bit value multiplied by ten can require 65 bits. The deliberately
conservative `S` above pins that boundary at two limbs on every implementation.

For long division with dividend width `n` and divisor width `d`:

```text
q = max(1, max(n, 1) - max(d, 1) + 1), with subtraction clamped at zero
division_work(n, d) = max(n, 1) + max(d, 1) + max(d, 1) * q
quotient_remainder_work(n, d) = division_work(n, d)
    + q * max(d, 1)
    + max(n, 1)
```

Rounded division uses one conservative all-mode bound. Let
`r = min(max(n, 1), max(d, 1))`; then:

```text
rounded_division_work(n, d) = quotient_remainder_work(n, d)
    + 2*r                         # remainder absolute-value and doubling scans
    + max(d, 1)                   # denominator absolute-value scan
    + max(max(d, 1), r + 1)       # doubled-remainder comparison
    + 1                           # nearest-even parity probe
    + q + 1                       # possible quotient adjustment
```

The same bound applies to every rounding mode so the selected tag and whether
the result is a tie do not create a gas side channel. Exact classification
first charges `numerator_limbs + 2 * denominator_limbs` for its absolute-value
and state-copy preparation. Every final conceptual result charges one scan of
its limb width before the signed-domain check. Checked integer operations also
include their generic-bigint and V1-domain result scans. Wrapping operations
separately charge arithmetic and the source scan, eight-limb sign fill,
truncation, and two eight-limb reconstruction/domain scans used by modulo
`2^512` reduction.

For avoidance of doubt, the directly precharged integer work formulas are:

| Operation | Logical work |
| --- | ---: |
| checked `int` negation | `v + 2*(v + 1)` |
| checked `int` addition or subtraction | `m + 2*(m + 1)`, where `m = max(l, r, 1)` |
| checked `int` multiplication | `l*r + 2*(l + r)` |
| checked `int` division or remainder | `QR(l, r) + 2*(q + min(l, r))` |
| any `int` comparison | `max(l, r, 1)` |
| wrapping negation before reduction | `2*v + 1` |
| wrapping addition/subtraction before reduction | `2*m + 1` |
| wrapping multiplication before reduction | `l*r + l + r` |
| wrapping reduction of a signed temporary with `x` limbs | `x + 3*8 + min(x, 8)` |

Here every operand width is at least one limb and `q` is the quotient-limb
bound above. A wrapping operation pays both its pre-reduction row and the
wrapping-reduction row. Simple representation conversions and scalar range
checks pay one scan of the source value; an output pointer, when present, is
still charged separately.

Decimal and quantity primitives report this closed work-event vocabulary.
The VM sums the listed work and debits `4 * work` immediately before each
reported event, so an implementation cannot fuse away a consensus charge or
perform an unreported backend pass:

| Work event | Logical work |
| --- | ---: |
| `CanonicalityProbe(m, scale)` | `0` when no probe is emitted; otherwise `QR(m, 1)` |
| `ScaleByPowerOfTen(v, d)` | `0` if `d = 0`; otherwise `C(d) + v*P(d)` |
| `Materialize(v)` | `max(v, 1)` |
| `Negate(v)` | `max(v, 1)` |
| `Add(l, r)` or `Subtract(l, r)` | `max(l, r, 1)` |
| `Multiply(l, r)` | `max(l, 1) * max(r, 1)` |
| `DivisionClassificationPrepare(n, d)` | `max(n, 1) + 2*max(d, 1)` |
| `DivisionClassification(n, d)` | `QR(n, d)` |
| `ExactDivisionAttempt(n, d)` | `QR(n, d)` |
| `RoundedDivision(n, d)` | `rounded_division_work(n, d)` |
| `Normalize(m, scale)` | `QR(m, 1)` for the divide-by-ten probe about to run |
| `Finalize(v)` | `max(v, 1)` |

Scale alignment emits `ScaleByPowerOfTen` or `Materialize` for both operands,
then the applicable add/subtract/compare event. Exact denominator reduction
emits preparation followed by every Euclidean/classification event actually
begun, and a terminating quotient emits one `ExactDivisionAttempt` at its
proven minimum scale. Rounded division emits exactly one bounded
`RoundedDivision` event after its scale operands are materialized. Result
canonicalization emits one `Normalize` event per attempted division by ten;
zero emits none.

Exact division first charges the Euclidean reduction and denominator
classification steps actually begun. Once classification proves a terminating
result, it charges the single division at the proven minimum output scale
immediately before that division. Decimal normalization charges each
divide-by-ten probe immediately before the probe. The dedicated zero rule
`(0, s) -> (0, 0)` performs no bigint division and therefore emits and charges
zero normalization probes. Conceptual scales through
56, aligned or scale-adjusted widths through ten limbs, and multiplication
intermediates through sixteen limbs are included in golden vectors.

Pointer processing is ordered and charged as follows:

1. debit the fixed entry charge;
2. debit the seven-byte header charge, then validate readable provenance and
   read the header;
3. validate the hard length cap with checked arithmetic;
4. debit the declared frame bytes for the envelope-snapshot phase, then debit
   `32 + frame_bytes` for supplied-digest handling and the complete
   `Hash::new(frame)` traversal;
5. snapshot exactly that range and validate its payload hash;
6. debit `4 * decode_work`, then validate the Norito header, schema, flags,
   length, and CRC; only if that succeeds, debit `4 * canonical_work`, then
   decode the numeric body; for a nonzero scaled decimal/quantity, debit
   `4 * canonicality_probe_work` immediately before its canonicality probe;
7. debit each arithmetic/normalization phase before it begins;
8. debit the signed-length probe, determine the exact output envelope length,
   then debit `envelope_bytes + 2 * frame_bytes` for framing/checksum,
   authentication hashing, and publication;
9. allocate and write the output, then publish result registers.

Malformed inputs never cause allocation based on an uncapped length. Guest
memory used for execution is the same snapshot used for validation. Numeric
bytes may also incur transport/state decoding gas outside the syscall; that is
an intentional transport cost and is distinct from syscall marshalling.

## Error precedence and atomicity

Validation follows the phase order above. Within an operand, pointer
provenance/type/version/length precede payload hash, which precedes frame/schema
and canonical-value validation. Pointer operands are authenticated and decoded
in register order. For rounded division and ratio calls, this includes fully
authenticating the `int` scale pointer in `r12` before interpreting either
scalar control: the rounding tag in `r13` is validated next, followed by the
failure tag in `r14`. Only after those malformed-call checks pass is the
decoded scale value resolved against `0..=28`; an out-of-range but canonical
scale is the recoverable `InvalidScale` numeric fault. Thus a bad scale pointer
precedes bad scalar controls, while a bad rounding or failure tag precedes a
semantic out-of-range scale.

Required-zero registers otherwise precede the failure tag according to each
published signature. The rounded decimal-to-int conversion is the explicit
special case: after authenticating `r10`, it checks required-zero `r11` and
`r12` before validating the rounding tag in `r13`; that conversion has no
failure-mode register. Invalid rounding, failure, or required-zero controls are
malformed-call traps with their distinct fault tags and are never converted to
status-mode arithmetic failures. All applicable control and scale checks
precede divisor-zero validation, which precedes arithmetic.

If a phase is unaffordable, out-of-gas for that phase takes precedence over an
error discoverable only by performing the phase. A phase that has not begun is
not charged. No numeric failure writes an output envelope. A recoverable fault
writes only the result/status registers. Trapping and out-of-gas paths leave
numeric output allocation and durable state unchanged.

## Ledger boundary

Ledger balances remain asset-associated quantities, not generic decimals.
Every boundary uses an explicit checked conversion equivalent to:

```text
quantity::try_from_decimal(value)
decimal::from_quantity(value)
```

The conversion is exact and enforces the ledger's scale/range and any
asset-definition precision policy. Negative values, excess precision, and
out-of-range ledger results have stable errors. Generic decimal values are not
implicitly accepted by mint, burn, transfer, fee, or balance APIs.

## First-release activation and validation gates

ABI V1 has not previously been released as a compatibility contract. This
definition replaces every pre-release V1 numeric layout and syscall surface.
Old ABI hashes and artifacts are rejected before execution. Retired pointer IDs
remain reserved so they cannot be reinterpreted.

Merge and release require:

- full workspace format, build, test, and strict clippy gates;
- compiler-folding versus runtime differential tests;
- an independent exact-arithmetic reference implementation;
- cross-SDK canonical frame fixtures;
- encode/decode and malformed-frame fuzzing;
- quote-free staged gas/OOG tests at every phase;
- boundary vectors at every signed-byte and logical-limb transition;
- exact division, all signed rounding ties, wrapping endpoints, and
  multiplication/alignment intermediates above the input limb maximum;
- stale artifact/ABI-hash rejection and canonical numeric map-key tests;
- execution parity across supported architectures and bigint backends.

msgid "You can interact with Iroha using various ways. You can use our client libraries to write code in various programming languages (e.g. Java, Python, Javascript, Swift) which communicates with Iroha. Alternatively, you can use ``iroha-cli`` – our command-line tool for interacting with Iroha. As a part of this guide, let's get familiar with ``iroha-cli``"

msgid "Despite that ``iroha-cli`` is arguably the simplest way to start working with Iroha, ``iroha-cli`` covers only some possible commands/queries, so user experience might not be the best. If you want to help us build a better CLI version please let us know!"

Next, enter a Domain ID. In our example we already have a domain ``test``, so let's use it. Then we need to enter an asset precision – the amount of numbers in a fractional part. Let's set precision to ``2``."

For example, to add 200.50 ``coolcoins``, we need to enter integer ``coolcoins``, we need to enter integer part as ``20050`` and precision as  part as ``20050`` and precision as ``2``, so it becomes ``200.50``."

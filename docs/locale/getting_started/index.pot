msgid "Of course you can build Iroha from scratch, modify its code and launch a customized node! If you are curious how to do that — you can check :ref:`build-guide` section. In this guide we will use a standard distribution of Iroha available as a docker image."

msgid "To operate, Iroha requires a ``PostgreSQL`` database. Let's start with creating a Docker network, so containers for Postgres and Iroha can run on the same virtual network and successfully communicate. In this guide we will call it ``iroha-network``, but you can use any name. In your terminal write following command:"

msgid "Don't be scared away — we have prepared an example configuration for this guide, so you can start testing Iroha node now. In order to get those files, you need to clone the `Iroha repository <https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha>`_ from Github or copy them manually (cloning is faster, though)."

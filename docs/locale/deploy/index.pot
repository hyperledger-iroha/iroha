msgid "Hyperledger Iroha can be deployed in different ways, depending on the perspective and the purpose. There can be either a single node deployed, or multiple nodes running in several containers on a local machine or spread across the network â€” so pick any case you need. This page describes different scenarios and is intended to act as a how-to guide for users, primarily trying out Iroha for the first time."

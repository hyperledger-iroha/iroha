msgid "By manual deployment, we mean that Iroha peer network is set up without automated assistance. It is similar to the process of running a single local instance, although the difference is the genesis block includes more than a single peer. In order to form a block, which includes more than a single peer, or requires customization for your needs, please take a look at `:ref:`deploy_troubles` section."

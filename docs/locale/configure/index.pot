msgid "``max_proposal_size`` is the maximum amount of transactions that can be in one proposal, and as a result in a single block as well. So, by changing this value you define the size of potential block. For a starter you can stick to ``10``. However, we recommend to increase this number if you have a lot of transactions per second."

#: ../../configure/index.rst:99
msgid "``proposal_delay`` is a timeout in milliseconds that a peer waits a response from the orderding service with a proposal."
msgstr ""

#: ../../configure/index.rst:101
msgid "``vote_delay`` is a waiting time in milliseconds before sending vote to the next peer. Optimal value depends heavily on the amount of Iroha peers in the network (higher amount of nodes requires longer ``vote_delay``). We recommend to start with 100-1000 milliseconds."
msgstr ""

#: ../../configure/index.rst:105
msgid "``mst_enable`` enables or disables multisignature transaction network transport in Iroha. Note that MST engine always works for any peer even when the flag is set to ``false``. The flag only allows sharing information about MST transactions among the peers."
msgstr ""

#: ../../configure/index.rst:111
msgid "``mst_expiration_time`` is an optional parameter specifying the time period in which a not fully signed transaction (or a batch) is considered expired (in minutes). The default value is 1440."
msgstr ""

#: ../../configure/index.rst:115
msgid "``max_rounds_delay`` is an optional parameter specifying the maximum delay between two consensus rounds (in milliseconds). The default value is 3000. When Iroha is idle, it gradually increases the delay to reduce CPU, network and logging load. However too long delay may be unwanted when first transactions arrive after a long idle time. This parameter allows users to find an optimal value in a tradeoff between resource consumption and the delay of getting back to work after an idle period."
msgstr ""

#: ../../configure/index.rst:125
msgid "``stale_stream_max_rounds`` is an optional parameter specifying the maximum amount of rounds to keep an open status stream while no status update is reported. The default value is 2. Increasing this value reduces the amount of times a client must reconnect to track a transaction if for some reason it is not updated with new rounds. However large values increase the average number of connected clients during each round."
msgstr ""

#: ../../configure/index.rst:133
msgid "``\"initial_peers`` is an optional parameter specifying list of peers a node will use after startup instead of peers from genesis block. It could be useful when you add a new node to the network where the most of initial peers may become malicious. Peers list should be provided as a JSON array:"

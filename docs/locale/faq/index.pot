msgstr ""

#: ../../faq/index.rst:20
msgid "Hyperleder Iroha allows you to send not only assets (you might get such impression due to a highly developed set of commands and queries for serving such assets) but any data that will be stored in the chain as well."

#: ../../faq/index.rst:22
msgid "The current implementation provides that opportunity at least via `SetAccountDetail <../develop/api/commands.html#set-account-detail>`_ command and `GetAccountDetail <../develop/api/queries.html#get-account-detail>`_ query."

msgid "If we are speaking about ARM-based hardware with some linux onboard (like Raspberry PI) or rooted Android device, then it is possible to launch Iroha as a node (a peer within a network) on that device. In that case, Iroha will run as a platform-native binary."
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq/index.rst:31
msgid "If we are speaking about default iOS or Android device with untouched factory shell (GUI), then it is generally not possible and we are not providing any instructions regarding this. Though you still can create mobile applications that use Iroha. They will be Iroha clients and would not serve as peers."

"""From a camera luma plane to lane data.

The decoder locates the corner finders, derives a homography for each
orientation hypothesis, ranks the hypotheses by their ring gates and the ``天``
mask, picks the one whose lane ``D`` codeword checks out (or whose tile lanes
read), then reads the tiles and dots. Every tile is classified *jointly*: the
8x8 sample patch is compared against the 32 hypotheses (polarity x glyph) and
the best match wins, so the katakana and the light/dark bit help each other.
Cells the decoder is unsure about become Reed-Solomon erasures.

When a thumb, a glare or the edge of the frame hides one corner blossom, the
other three locate the code and the hidden corner is inferred, then moved to
where the three dotted rings line up best. :func:`track_frame` follows a code
from the previous frame's pose without searching the whole image.

The tile *level read* judges every patch against the light and dark levels
measured at the finders. When it leaves lane ``P`` or ``K`` unreadable, the
*normalised read* is tried: it rescales each patch (and each template) by its
own contrast, so over-exposure, veiling light, glare, shadows and gradients
cancel out.

This is an operation-by-operation port of the Rust reference in IEEE double
precision, including the order of every floating-point sum, so it reads the
same lanes from the same pixels.

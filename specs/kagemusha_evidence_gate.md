# KAGEMUSHA verification checklist

Status: working checklist, 2026-10-06, for proposal revision 2026-10-05 (split
lineage). This document records useful checks for
[the single protocol](kagemusha_single_design_proposal.md). It is not an
approval process and does not block use, production integration or deployment.
The filename is retained for existing links. Section 8 records current
component checks; complete protocol and physical-device qualification remain open.

Runtime signature, proof, authorization, replay and durability checks remain
part of the protocol. Removing a release gate does not make an invalid
payment valid or make an unimplemented security property an established fact.

## 1. What the evidence should distinguish

A state package contains its step proof `σ` and provider receipt `τ`. Send,
Unload and Retiring commit only from a folded head and their packages also
carry the lineage wrap `Ω` of that predecessor; Bootstrap, Load, Receive,
ArchiveSent and RefreshPolicy may commit from an unfolded head and carry no
`Ω`. The operation tag fixes the receipt's `proof_digest` domain. Before
`Advance`, the wallet natively verifies the incoming packages, proves `σ` and
natively verifies it. The provider then executes atomic, durable
`Advance(expected_head, new_head, proof_digest, operation_id, recovery_capsule)`
and produces `τ`, which it natively verifies before release. In the background
the wallet proves the lineage proof `Λ` and its wrap `Ω` and natively verifies
`Ω`; verifiers reject a Send, Unload or Retiring package, or a fee claim, that
lacks its predecessor `Ω`. The current receipt is checked natively; the lineage
proof covering a step verifies its own and incoming receipts recursively. Tests
should follow that order and bind the receipt to the exact proof digest and
state transition.

A committed Send irreversibly debits `amount + fee`. Recovery delivers the
same exact Payment bytes to the bound receiver, which credits them once.
Timeout, interruption, rejection, missing delivery evidence or sender regret
never restores the debit. No step or lineage relation has a reversal operation.

The single target uses a software provider and marker in the released wallet
on a stock vendor OS. The phone must be unrooted, not jailbroken and free of
rootkits or other OS compromise. Enrollment verifies available platform
evidence, including locked verified boot where attested. Continued absence of
runtime compromise is a security assumption, not a fact proven by enrollment.
Record that assumption with every result. Stronger hardware enforcement
against a hostile OS is optional research, not a prerequisite for this design.

Platform attestation records particular signed facts about a key, app or boot.
It does not establish that the running OS is uncompromised at payment time.
A valid transition proof does not, by itself, establish that its predecessor
was never used elsewhere. Record the component that enforces that property.

The checklist follows the completed-payment properties in the proposal:

| Property | What to check |
|---|---|
| P1a | Accepted value is durably owned at completion, subject only to the P4 exception. |
| P1b | Once the receiver's local fold reaches its current head, which covers the crediting head, with no network, counterparty or approval, the value is spendable onward offline and can be unloaded. |
| P2 | The payer cannot spend it again under the provider's stated security assumptions. |
| P3 | Completion needs no later reconciliation, approval or settlement. |
| P4 | Later discovery of payer misconduct does not revoke an honest recipient's accepted value. The sole exception burns only an incoming Payment that passed native checks but fails in the receiver's lineage proof. |
| P5 | Only an explicitly enabled regulatory control requires connectivity. |
| PC | Native verification, the receiver's step proof, the durable commit, recovery data and fold witnesses finish before the receiver reports completion; only the local lineage fold follows, and it changes ownership only by the P4 burn branch. |

## 2. Records and independently runnable work

Use a record per check: **not run**, **observed as expected**, **deviation**,
**source reading**, or **not accessible**. Include the steps, expected result,
actual result and limits of the conclusion. None of these labels grants or
withholds permission to use or integrate the implementation.

Identify the protocol revision, source commit, dependency lock, build hashes,
step and lineage relations and wrap, provider and firmware, attestation policy,
device model, OS build, security patch and carrier. Keep the raw signed bytes,
proofs, key hashes, logs, timings and fault traces alongside the reproducible
procedure.
Where raw evidence contains identifying data, retain it in controlled storage
and record its digest and access location. Pin external source code by commit;
record vendor-document retrieval dates and content hashes.

The work below can start independently. Primitive discovery and relation
design can proceed together. Storage probes and carrier measurements need no
prover; label their stand-in payloads explicitly. Complete proof and device
checks naturally need the corresponding implementation, but are not
prerequisites for other integration work. Long-duration experiments can run
beside development; there is no mandatory 90-day wait.

## 3. Provider behavior and platform claims

- Capture actual Android TEE and StrongBox attestations independently. Record
  the chain, origin, security levels, hardware/software-enforced fields,
  use-limit tags, app identity, boot and patch claims, and evidence freshness.
  A feature flag or another vendor's result does not describe this device.
- Capture Apple evidence separately. App Attest authenticates its own key and
  supplied transcript; it does not independently attest a separate payment
  key or report payment-time OS integrity.
- Identify which trusted component owns the current head, enforces
  `expected_head`, commits the successor and retains the recovery outcome.
  Document how a verifier authenticates the provider and its contract.
- Interrupt signing before its result returns. If the successor was selected,
  retry or recovery must yield that same committed package offline. A selected
  head with no recoverable outcome is a durability defect, not merely latency.

The following hostile-OS experiments are optional research beyond the target
assumption. They do not gate integration or production use. Their results
must not be reported as guarantees of the software provider:

- Bypass the app and OS key-store service where research access permits.
  Begin concurrent operations from one head, varying messages, cancellation
  and completion order. Look for two different receipts accepted for the same
  predecessor. Record whether the interface itself serialized the attempts.
- Save and replay key blobs and host database rows after use. Upgrade the same
  old blob twice and exercise every returned copy. Record which component
  prevents a second authorized successor.
- For a counter candidate, attempt chosen and repeated counters, concurrent
  assertions and assertions after rollback. A failed hook shows only that
  the attempted attack failed; it does not prove counter unforgeability.
- Record how a rooted, unlocked or research device differs from the ordinary
  device. Do not transfer results across changed enforcement without an
  explicit supporting argument. Inaccessible privileged tests remain
  inaccessible, rather than evidence of security.

## 4. State machine, proof storage and crash recovery

Check the written authority contract and the implemented transition relations
against the same fields: scheme, asset, predecessor, operation, counterparty,
amounts, successor, proof digest and recovery capsule. Trace the durable
linearization point before release of a usable Payment.

Exercise sends, receives, loads, unloads, delivery retries and phone replacement
under message loss, duplication, reordering, concurrency, process death,
power loss and restoration of older host files.

Here, migration means phone replacement through an ordinary offline payment,
not a separate monetary operation. A change of scheme uses voluntary unload
and load through the ledger, with no required change to an existing wallet.

Expected invariants:

- Loads and transfers conserve value. Arithmetic cannot overflow, underflow
  or cross assets or schemes. The proof and native verifier agree.
- A Request is a signed setup quote bound to both wallets, the payer's next
  send ordinal, amount, fee terms and nonce. It creates no monetary state,
  exclusive receive slot or receiver ordinal. A stale or declined quote can
  prevent a new Send; cancellation, replacement or later expiry of the quote
  cannot invalidate an already committed Payment.
- Each Send consumes its send ordinal and debits `amount + fee` exactly once.
  After its commit, every timeout, crash, transport error, receiver decline and
  lost delivery evidence leaves that debit unchanged. No step or lineage
  relation has an operation that restores it on those grounds; reject retired
  refund/refusal monetary objects and attempts to recredit the sender through
  other operations.
- Receive checks nonmembership of the exact `credit_id` against the
  consumed-credit store authenticated by the head's `consumed_credit_root`,
  inside the serialized `Advance` section, credits once and inserts
  `credit_id → (amount, receive sequence)` in the same committed transition.
  Its receipt binds the complete Payment digest, which no state commitment or
  `σ_recv` statement contains; `Λ_recv` later proves the update and the digest
  in-circuit and records the digest in the credit-digest root. Entries are
  permanent. Deliver a delayed Payment after unrelated receives and then replay
  it repeatedly, including after restart and delivery evidence cleanup: only
  the first valid Receive changes the balance. Repeat with a restored stale
  native store, which fails authentication against the head roots, and with
  duplicate delivery on two carriers during a `σ_recv` re-prove, which credits
  once. A `σ` whose successor root differs from the root recomputed from the
  authenticated store is discarded before commit.
- An incoming Payment that passes every native check but fails in `Λ_recv`,
  including a duplicate `credit_id`, takes the burn branch: its `credit_id`
  stays consumed, `Λ`'s `burned_total` grows by its amount, the credit-digest
  root records it as burned, no accumulator of the burned Payment enters `Ω`,
  the receiver's other value stays spendable and reserve accounting counts the
  burned credit. Only that Payment is burned. Every later Send, Unload and
  Retiring `σ` takes `burned_total` from `Ω(pred)`; a `σ` that uses the stale
  core value is rejected natively and in `Λ`.
- Send, Unload and Retiring packages carry their predecessor `Ω`; Send,
  Unload, fee claims, retirement and device moves from an unfolded head are
  rejected. A wallet's next Send waits until its current head is folded, also
  after its own previous Send. Crash and restore between commit and fold
  resume the fold from retained witnesses; loss of a fold witness or of a
  native authenticated store without a recoverable copy is reported as custody
  loss, never a silent wait.
- A Payment whose Request names a different payer wallet than `Ω(pred)`, or
  whose carried payment key or credential digest differs from `Ω(pred)`'s, is
  rejected before mutation, and so is a payer credential from the Offer whose
  digest differs.
- With each regulatory control enabled, the receiver's verification of
  `σ_send` rejects a Send that violates it, and a `σ_send` proved under the
  verifying key for a different enabled-controls mask than `Ω(pred)`'s.
- Each ordinary load receipt and redemption is consumed at most once. Funding and
  retirement cannot recreate a consumed receipt or reverse a committed Send.
- A nonzero fee is earned at Send. Its exact retained Payment authorizes one
  fee payout, keyed by `credit_id`, only to its fixed beneficiary. Claim the fee
  before Receive and retry after Receive: there is one payout total. Failed
  delivery or decline neither cancels the fee entitlement nor restores its
  debit. Map leaves and immutable capsule bodies do not contain the very
  receipt or final package that authenticates them.
- Optional Credited evidence is the committed Receive package or a read-only
  `CreditStatus` {statement, `proof_digest`, receipt, `Ω`, opening} against a
  folded receiver head. Verify the Receive package's step proof and provider
  receipt, which binds the exact Payment digest, or decide the folded head's
  `Ω`, check its receipt and the opening of `credit_id → (Payment digest,
  burned flag)` in `Ω`'s credit-digest root, recipient and scope. Another
  Payment, an unconsumed credit or an invalid receipt fails; a burned credit
  reports **delivered, burned**. `ArchiveSent` verifies this evidence natively
  before `Advance` and in `Λ_archive`, and removes only the corresponding
  retained outbox entry, without a monetary effect. If the in-circuit check
  fails, `Λ_archive` takes the no-op branch: the entry stays pending in `Ω`'s
  pending-outgoing root, its Payment bytes are kept, and it can be archived
  again after a later Send, Unload or Retiring. The payer deletes the delivered
  Payment bytes only after a durable `Ω` covers the ArchiveSent step on its
  archive branch.
  Evidence loss cannot change either balance or remove a permanent
  consumed-credit entry. The flow creates no acknowledgement chain,
  receiver pruning obligation or prerequisite for onward spending.
- `Advance` retries recover the same committed outcome. Once a Payment is
  assembled and released, every retry returns its exact original bytes,
  including proof and receipt. Crash before release must finish the selected
  Send, retain its complete Payment and deliver that Payment; it cannot select
  another successor, regenerate a different released Payment or restore value.
  Loss of every retained copy of released bytes reports delivery-data loss;
  generating a new receipt or proof is not recovery. Inject a faulty receipt
  signature before first release: it fails native self-verification and is
  signed again, and no failing receipt is released.
- Phone replacement uses the ordinary payment path. Interruptions preserve
  its exact outcome; the old phone retains unresolved obligations, with no
  copied balance or separate migration authority.
- Crashes preserve authenticated recovery bytes sufficient to reconstruct
  the complete package and prove its next transition offline. Temporary host
  unavailability permits retry. Deliberate total erasure of the private
  recovery bytes is custody loss: a digest cannot reconstruct those bytes.
- Every message, per-operation buffer and recovery object respects the
  proposal's bounds. Exercise zero, the limit and one over it. Preflight
  available storage before accepting an operation. Unresolved operations can
  accumulate indefinitely. Permanent consumed-credit entries and their map
  openings also consume storage; do not prune them by age or claim globally
  bounded wallet storage.
- Capacity pressure is handled before acceptance. Preserve already committed
  Payments and distinguish a capacity wait from loss of accepted value. Test
  repeated, cyclic and branching histories and migrations, including growth
  of unresolved operations, rather than only a short acyclic payment chain.
- An older wallet can verify and spend its admitted packages after another
  wallet upgrades. Exercise the unchanged step relations, lineage relation,
  wrap, verifying-key allowlist and verification interface within the scheme
  without an unconfigured requirement to reconnect.
- Retirement: race load issuance with the atomic ledger instruction that closes
  new loads. Previously committed receipts stay recoverable and new loads after
  closure debit nothing. Deliver an already committed Payment while the receiver
  is retiring; it remains receivable once. Also issue a quote before Retiring,
  commit its Send afterwards and deliver it: retiring cannot cancel that credit.
  Retirement stops issuing new quotes and preserves old receive custody.
  Neither a zero balance nor a receipt proves
  that no delayed incoming Payment exists. Intentional custody deletion reports
  the loss of late incoming value; it is not a safe monetary drain certificate.
- Interrupted enrollment: try funding a load before the ledger records the
  completed Bootstrap receipt; the transaction fails without debit. Abandon is permitted
  only while the original enrollment marker remains selected and Bootstrap has
  never committed. Once Bootstrap commits, including an uncertain activation
  response, resume that incarnation and use Retiring; do not select Abandon.
  If a load is funded, consume its original receipt once without cancelling its
  obligation, refunding its mint, resetting ordinals or initializing a second
  authority. Abandoning an unused enrollment changes no monetary balance.
- Time anchors: delay the issuer's response to near the response-age bound and
  sign it just before a lease end; the wallet must treat the lease as ended.
  Sleep the device for hours while anchored; elapsed time must include the
  sleep. A Send whose time interval touches two windows is counted in both.
- Marker coverage: at every step of enrollment, a normal transition,
  retirement and abandonment, the key is covered by exactly one durable current
  marker or a terminal marker.

Use a finite-state model for adversarial schedules and an inductive argument
for unbounded executions. State the bounds of each model check; a bounded
search does not prove unbounded-hop safety. Review the provider contract and
proof relations together, identifying which component discharges each
obligation instead of having each assume the other enforces it.

## 5. Real proofs and protocol interoperability

Generate real zero-state and load proofs, step proofs, lineage proofs and wraps
for a complete load → A → B → C → unload lineage. Include split/change, delayed
and duplicate delivery, receive-then-send, phone replacement and cyclic
transfers. Retain witness fixtures, proofs, verification keys and component
resource measurements, including lineage fold time, peak memory and energy.

Try forked predecessors, changed amounts, duplicate and reordered credits,
forged or substituted provider receipts, altered proof digests, missing
ancestor authorization, mixed schemes, wrong assets, malformed encodings and
mismatched relation identifiers. Record the trust boundary rejecting each
case. Mutation tests should show a named failure when a monetary invariant
is removed; ordinary valid fixtures alone do not exercise that invariant.
Include mutations that restore a committed Send after timeout or decline,
omit consumed-credit insertion, permit its later removal, or replace the
retained Payment bytes during recovery. Each must be rejected or violate a
named invariant in the test. Replace a Payment's P-256 signature `s` with
`n - s`, and vary signature encodings or verification dependencies. Native
and recursive checks must reject altered bytes; they must not normalize an
incoming Payment into a different digest or insert an alternate consumed entry.
Signing normalizes before freezing the original canonical object.

Compare native and recursive verification of the same package. Native and
in-circuit verifiers must accept exactly the same set for every object that
`Λ` verifies after a native check: run differential and fuzz tests, in the
relation owners' CI, over `Ω` including its deferred values, `σ`, `τ`, the
  Request, Credited evidence, ordinary load receipts and finality, fee schedules, certificates,
credentials, and policy, list, time and credential updates. Exercise the
poison-pill burn branch of `Λ_recv` and the no-op branch of `Λ_archive`; a
tampered deferred value; a mixed history; a wrong relation identity; a `σ`
under the wrong verifying key for its operation tag or enabled-controls mask;
an `Ω` whose head, credential digest or payment key does not match the `σ`
statement or `τ`; a `σ` whose `burned_total` or pending-outgoing input differs
from `Ω(pred)`'s; and a receipt whose `proof_digest` omits or swaps `Ω`, or
uses the domain of another operation tag. Check that current receipts are verified before credit and that
successor lineage proofs bind those receipts to the exact predecessor and
incoming packages. Check that an invalid package cannot become valid merely by
wrapping it in another proof.

The scheme keeps its fixed step relations, lineage relation, wrap,
verifying-key allowlist and verification interface for its lifetime. Test
voluntary transfers to a different scheme separately; breaking changes cannot
require old wallets to update or reconnect to keep using their existing value.

## 6. Complete device exchanges

Run real proofs and the software provider on stock phones for each claimed
device and ordered sender/receiver/carrier combination. Label runs with
padded proofs so their timings are not attributed to a real prover. Record
untested combinations without claiming platform or vendor universality.

- A pays B; after B reports complete and its local fold reaches its current
  head, B pays all received value to C with radios off. Before that fold, B
  shows the completed credit as **spendable after local proof** with its fold
  backlog, and Send and Unload wait for the fold. Repeat after restart, temporary
  storage unavailability and recoverable faults. Record total
  private-recovery-byte erasure as custody loss, not successful recovery from
  a digest. Inspect both endpoints: the payer reports its durable Send
  independently and reports **delivered** only from valid receiver completion
  evidence.
- After A commits Send, interrupt delivery before B receives it; also exercise
  a decline, capacity failure and a lost Credited message. A's amount and fee
  never return. B can receive other payments before the original exact Payment
  is retried, and can then credit that Payment once. Withhold optional Credited
  evidence and confirm that B's accepted value becomes onward-spendable after
  its fold without that evidence. Recover that evidence later through
  `CreditStatus` without changing B's state.
- Cut power at authority, proof-store, journal and release boundaries,
  including inside `Advance` and after commit but before return. Distinguish
  forced restart from actual loss of power to storage. Test locked,
  unavailable and full storage without treating transient errors as absence.
- Exercise platform backup, vendor transfer, reinstall and update paths.
  Repeat rollback attempts against the actual provider boundary, and record
  precisely which destructive events are outside its durability assumptions.
- After B accepts value from A, give B and C authenticated misconduct evidence
  about A. B's credit remains usable, and C accepts B's otherwise valid
  package. Check native and recursive verification.
- With regulatory controls off, pay, recover and spend onward offline after
  reboots, clock changes and long idle periods. Run each enabled control
  separately. Record the longest tested interval and any network dependency.
- On a device class that fails or has no published lineage budget,
  activation, Load, Receive and RefreshPolicy refuse before commit, and the
  load receipt or Payment stays deliverable. On each passing class,
  measure fold time, peak memory and energy per operation, including folds
  interrupted by app suspension and resumed at the next app run. With a
  receiver's Request-issuance policy (minimum amount, rate limit, maximum
  unfolded backlog), new quotes stop at the configured limit and committed
  Payments stay receivable.
- Measure every package-carrying message against the **10,000-byte** bound,
  including the Lineage message, the single-parity `Ω` inside Payment and a
  CreditStatus, and each Offer with the payer credential against **2,048
  bytes**. If `Ω` cannot keep Payment, or CreditStatus cannot keep Credited,
  within 10,000 bytes, record a deviation; a fallback is a new owner decision.
  Report schemes with enabled controls separately. Measure
  the **2-second p95** target from payer confirmation after the Request to the
  receiver's durable completion (P1a). Include intervening framing, retries,
  carrier setup, the payer's remaining step-proof time, receiver verification,
  the receiver step proof and both durable commits. Report separately, per
  device class, the fold time until the value is ready to spend onward and
  tap-to-done including setup and the confirmation dwell. Measure the payer's
  later delivery confirmation separately. State sample counts and the
  percentile estimator before measurement; retain raw samples, failures, cold/warm
  results, peak memory, energy and thermal effects. These are requirements
  and targets, not measured results.

Zero observed failures does not establish zero failure probability. Under
independent, identically distributed Bernoulli trials, n clean trials give an
approximate 95% upper failure-rate bound of 3/n. Adaptive attacks, correlated
storage faults and different devices do not acquire that model merely by
repetition. An empirically successful delay is not a storage durability
contract. Record counterexamples and repair the underlying mechanism.

## 7. Integration and existing material

Compare node, issuer, wallet core, Swift and Kotlin implementations using the
same canonical vectors and real packages. Exercise ledger loads, unloads,
fees and migrations on a valid multi-peer network. Check reserve accounting,
replay indexes, finality and issuer/provider key separation. State the stock-OS
assumption with the deployed software provider; do not describe its marker
as hardware enforcement against an OS takeover.

Re-run affected checks after changes to provider, firmware, OS, step or
lineage relations, wrap or storage behavior. Record what results still apply
and how existing offline packages interoperate. Use the proposal's retirement map and actual caller
inventory when consolidating implementations; verification work does not
create a separate approval condition for integration or production use.

Starting points, not evidence that this protocol has passed:

- Android: `kotlin/kagemusha-wallet-android/src/main/java/org/hyperledger/iroha/sdk/offline/wallet/` (the Android `Advance` adapter, payment-key and backup rules) and `kotlin/core-jvm/src/main/java/org/hyperledger/iroha/sdk/offline/KagemushaP256Codec.kt`. Generate and inspect keys even when feature flags are negative. The old KeyMint single-use probes of the retired protocol were deleted.
- Apple: `IrohaSwift/Sources/IrohaSwift/KagemushaWalletApplePlatformV1.swift` and `KagemushaWalletAppleAppAttestV1.swift` in the same directory (Secure Enclave payment key and App Attest enrollment evidence of step E5). The old `examples/ios/KagemushaAppAttestProbe/` app of the retired protocol was deleted.
- Attestation: `kotlin/core-jvm/src/main/java/org/hyperledger/iroha/sdk/crypto/keystore/attestation/` and `python/iroha_app_attestation/src/iroha_app_attestation/`.
- Formal work: none at HEAD. The old `formal/kagemusha_v1/` model of the retired protocol was deleted; write a new model from the proposal.
- Evidence records: §8 below. The old physical-evidence record of the retired hardware protocol and its verifier script were deleted; record new device results here with their provider assumptions.
- [Pinned AOSP characteristics](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/system/keymint/+/fda4e68d32f8dfc103e0283b4bfc41503ecfb19f/common/src/tag.rs), [operations](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/system/keymint/+/fda4e68d32f8dfc103e0283b4bfc41503ecfb19f/ta/src/operation.rs) and [upgrades](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/system/keymint/+/fda4e68d32f8dfc103e0283b4bfc41503ecfb19f/ta/src/keys.rs): reference behavior, not vendor-firmware evidence.
- [Android attestation](https://developer.android.com/privacy-and-security/security-key-attestation), [Apple validation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/devicecheck/validating-apps-that-connect-to-your-server) and [Apple fraud-risk guidance](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/devicecheck/assessing-fraud-risk): capture the exact statements and their limits in each evidence record.

## 8. Recorded results

### Current implementation checkpoint (2026-10-08)

The resumed `optimizations` checkout advanced from `ad75acfe2a` through
`7f14c2389c` and `505a5bd87d` to `28499f4150` while checks were
running. Merge conflicts were resolved, but consumed CoreZk, bridge, data-model
and filesystem sources changed.
SDK and component results below belong to their captured pre-merge inputs;
the merged candidate requires rebuilt checks. A commit hash alone does not
reproduce the continuing edits.
Earlier component results belong to their captured source and binary, not
retroactively to this checkout. No authenticated artifact
set, full-protocol qualification, phone result or completed offline payment is
claimed. Earlier measurements of deleted implementations below do not qualify
this candidate. The [Λ/Ω construction](kagemusha_lambda_omega_v1.md#10-milestones-named-tests-and-thresholds)
defines the unchanged engineering limits and current shared-host method.

**Evidence availability.** The resumed filesystem no longer contains the
four-row M3 campaign, canonical finality metadata snapshot 2, Linux enrollment
guest receipt, later JS/Python supplements or fresh consensus mutation review.
Those results cannot be independently rechecked from this checkout and do not
qualify the current candidate. The interrupted canonical source and full52 jobs
have no terminal receipts or signed complete wallet grant. Independent recovery
rereads all 1,043 surviving content-addressed originals (65,074,847,520 bytes),
with unchanged custody and no surviving producer or terminal output. A fresh
full52 run reconstructs the complete descriptor/key graph before strictly
importing any reusable proving key. It uses the preserved captured compiler;
current-owner qualification remains mandatory. Records are retained in
`canonical-complete52-interruption-review-2` and
`canonical-complete52-after-interruption-1` under `target/qualification`.
The retained four-row engine and
oracle executables still match their recorded hashes; fresh M3 qualification is
required after the implementation and harness are fixed. The availability
inventory is `target/qualification/resume-20261008/retention.json`; it records
filesystem observations, not replacement test evidence.

**Resumed component validation.** The retained engine capture passes 94 Pasta
units, 266 Plonk units and the separately selected large GLV differential case.
Its independently reviewed compiler inputs and copied binaries remain bound to
that capture. After keygen cleanup and lint repairs, the fresh copied oracle
passes all 42 ordinary and eight explicit large correctness cases, including
complete proof-byte parity and mutation checks. Its binary remains unchanged;
the broad source-drift result remains retained separately from the consumed-input
review in `target/qualification/keygen-cancellation-oracle-current`.
Current Pasta/Plonk library and test targets pass strict Clippy.
The combined proof/CoreZk/Torii/configuration test-target check and artifact CLI
check pass; concurrent engine edits during that check restrict it to compilation
evidence. The last gadget strict lint failed on 570 library diagnostics; the
separate warning-only diagnostic is not a strict pass. Reviewed source fixes are
now applied, together with lookup compression simplification and earlier wiping
and release of the dead denominator allocation. Both-field regression tests are
added. All six optimized engine test targets now compile. Independent review
checks 73 actual compiler depfiles, 1,461 source inputs, 4,135 package files and
five cfg-only generators; the 22 concurrent Deploy/Wallet edits are outside
that compiled graph. Correctness execution, strict lint and complete proof-byte
parity remain required before measuring this candidate. Captured binaries and
the original broad source-drift verdict are retained in
`target/qualification/engine23-capture-1`. The source port is recorded in
`target/qualification/engine23-production-port-1`. Earlier records are under
`target/qualification/keygen-advice-capture-20261008`,
`keygen-cancellation-strict-2`, `keygen-m3-gadgets-strict-1` and
`finality-server-import-check-3` within the same qualification directory.

The Rust account SDK's bounded Load event-path API and existing Load receipt
transport pass all 13 focused cases (seven existing and six event-path cases),
with zero failures or ignored tests. They cover exact account/network signing,
canonical Norito, malformed or oversized paths, deadline cancellation and
blocking-runtime entry. All compiled inputs, generated samples, tools and the
copied executable remain unchanged. Unrelated uncompiled Deploy/Wallet Rust
edits are recorded separately; the original broad build verdict and first
overbroad runtime refusal are preserved. These are transport component results,
not finality proof or monetary-network results
(`rust-sdk-kagemusha-capture-1/runtime-2`). The same-network controller passes
21 local orchestration controls. Its first build with the new continuation
stopped on a missing module-path declaration; no live monetary campaign ran.

The copied six-executable component capture passes server cache 13, artifact CLI
11, verifier recipes 10, catalog intake 10, continuity cancellation 2, Torii
lifecycle 6 and parent queue 2, configuration 9, registration 2, compact intake 3 and fold-preemption
2 selected cases. These selections are not a count of unique workspace tests.
The cache cases include real proofs on both curves after eviction and exact
deterministic regeneration. The scheduler cases use production coordination with
explicitly mocked proof work. Full-graph and genuine compact-proof cases remain
ignored pending artifacts. Independent review checks 91 actual compiler depfiles,
5,234 ordinary inputs and five generated inputs, including 13 exactly reproduced
generated files. The original broad build-drift verdict and server-runtime merge
drift remain retained in
`target/qualification/finality-server-component-capture-1`; this evidence belongs
to the preserved binaries, not the subsequent merged source.

The current complete host Swift run passes 2,180 tests across three XCTest
bundles (4, 2,104 and 72), with zero failures. The canonical local runner rebuilt
its native bridge and completed both source/artifact admission checks, including
verification after execution. This includes 191 KAGEMUSHA cases, the new
collection/deletion APIs and five actual native confidential-prover cases.
Logs and producer records are retained in `target/qualification/swift-local-zlwyzn1a`;
the completion receipt and exact three test executables are retained under
`native-terminal-sdk-swift-current-1`. The copied Mach-O files alone are not
runnable XCTest bundles. The earlier 2,174-test pre-change capture remains in
`swift-local-ee69gvae`. Neither host run establishes device or complete monetary
protocol qualification.

The current C# native-consumer selection passes 543 cases, including six actual
confidential-prover cases, with zero failures or skips and the exact rebuilt
ABI27 dylib observed by the loader. Source and compiled artifacts remain
unchanged. The wrapper initially refused its 518-case discovery count: one
selected theory expands into 26 data rows at execution. Independent review
matches those 26 rows to the source and confirms every other method's count and
filter membership. The original refusal and separate reconciliation are retained
under `target/qualification/csharp-current-abi27-1`. This establishes the
selected host consumers, not installed release-package or network readiness.
After the observation surface changed, the six actual C# native cases also pass
against the preserved `37d3b93c…554dd9` library with its actual loader path
observed. Managed inputs and compiled outputs remain unchanged. This separate
receipt, `target/qualification/csharp-native-captured-abi27-3/runtime-result.json`,
explicitly does not qualify current native sources; their admission refusal is
retained separately.

The collection and custody-deletion SDK changes pass 16 focused
managed Kotlin tests with JDK 21 and the JDK 8 API compile guard retained. The
run binds unchanged SDK inputs, compiled classes and XML results under
`target/qualification/native-terminal-sdk-kotlin-managed-2`. This covers typed
status parsing, immutable collection values, owner-bound one-use deletion
reviews and uncertain-outcome recovery; it excludes host JNI execution and
physical custody. ABI/header parity and the no-legacy-codec guard also pass for
the coordinated source changes. The rebuilt ABI27 host `b968de18…fda800` also
passes 62 fresh Kotlin/Java JNI cases: nine wallet/deletion/collection probes,
18 privacy cases, 25 SoraFS cases and ten signer cases, with zero failures or
skips. SDK/fixture sources and the selected artifact are unchanged before and
after execution. The loader receives the sole explicit library directory;
independent mapped-library path observation was unavailable. The retained
receipt is `target/qualification/native-terminal-sdk-kotlin-native-current-2`;
its initial test-probe compile failure is retained separately. These host
boundary checks do not open a genuine funded wallet or qualify a phone. The
current captured Rust collection/deletion selection passes 47 of 48 cases,
including all 26 bridge cases. Its one failure is a test expecting empty-map
warnings from a fixture whose three map roots are nonempty. The narrowly
corrected expectation awaits a rebuilt run; the original failure and unchanged
runtime sources, tools and binaries are retained in
`finality-per-use-compiler-capture-1/collection-terminal-runtime-1`.

The merged wallet observation surface now shares one native C/JNI dispatcher
for metadata, retained peer output and prepared Load data. Kotlin and Java
consumers pass eight managed tests with the JDK 8 API guard retained
(`target/qualification/kotlin-observation-managed-current-1`). The canonical
Kotlin account codec remains the single owner. Mandatory ABI27 inventory now
contains 88 C/JNI exports; header parity, 60 mismatch controls and 69 artifact
tests with 347 subtests pass. Originals are retained under
`observation-jni-inventory-check-3`, including earlier tooling failures.
The previous ABI27 artifact lacks the newly required exports and is correctly
refused. The rebuilt ABI27 host `37d3b93c…554dd9` passes 65 fresh Kotlin/Java
JNI cases, including the new observation probe and both canonical account
codec tests. Sources, fixtures and artifact bytes remain unchanged; the receipt
is `target/qualification/kotlin-observation-jni-current-1`. The loader used the
sole explicit artifact directory; an independent mapped-library observation
was unavailable. This covers the host boundary, not a funded wallet or phone.
The complete rebuilt Swift suite also passes 2,203 unique tests across three
XCTest bundles (4, 2,127 and 72), with zero failures or skips. The canonical
runner completes its post-execution artifact check against the same current
ABI27 dylib. The receipt is
`target/qualification/kotlin-observation-swift-current-1/completion-review.json`;
the earlier 2,180-case capture remains evidence for its own preserved candidate.

The fresh Python installed-wheel selection passes all five native consumer
tests with zero failures or skips. The emitted native module, wheel payload
and installed module have the same SHA `2117d3e4…63d14e`; source, actual Cargo
inputs, tools and installed files remain unchanged through final verification.
The retained result is
`target/qualification/python-native-local-unit-current-abi27-3/artifact/result.json`.
The two earlier producer refusals remain recorded. This is a local component
result; the clean-source release packaging guard remains unchanged and no
release, wallet exchange or phone qualification follows.

The next JavaScript capture executes all six original native cases successfully,
but post-run admission rejects a data-model finality source change. Its original
`passed: false` result remains in
`target/qualification/js-native-current-abi27-2/runtime/result.json`.
The subsequent attempt refuses a changed Node executable before compilation.
After selecting the actual Node executable, another build succeeds but artifact
admission refuses a consumed `iroha_torii_shared` source change, before runtime.
Both refusals remain under `js-native-current-abi27-{3,4}`; neither is a native
test pass for the current candidate.
The new Core/CoreZk capture passes 24 explicitly selected setup, registration and
finality diagnostics (14 Core and ten CoreZk). Its binaries and original
mixed-source verdict remain unchanged in
`target/qualification/monetary-pipeline-capture-1/diagnostic-runtime-1`.
These checks do not qualify the merged source or complete monetary exchange.

The first real-network daemon/CLI capture passes its stock-feature audit and
independent compiler-input review, including exact reproduction of generated
tables. The companion harness builds successfully but its consumed data-model
source changes during compilation, so source admission refuses it before
network execution. Both original verdicts remain under
`target/qualification/real-network-monetary-{stock,harness}-capture-1`.
The second stock daemon/CLI capture also passes exact consumed-input review and
independent generated-table reproduction. Its original broad drift verdict is
retained: only uncompiled harness/documentation paths changed during that build.
A later merge changed 24 consumed inputs, so these binaries cannot be paired
with a harness compiled from the current checkout. The exact comparison is
retained in `post-merge-current-source-refusal.json`; no network runtime was
started. A matching daemon/harness rebuild remains required. Originals are
under `target/qualification/real-network-monetary-stock-capture-2`.
The second harness also builds, but admission observes two consumed Torii
telemetry source files changing during compilation and refuses it. Its original
binary, input inventory and refusal remain under the corresponding
`real-network-monetary-harness-capture-2`; no network test is counted as passed.

All eight native Send control masks and both Receive variants complete their
measurement and separate one-key footprint processes: 20 processes pass, with
all 304 timed proofs independently verified. Locally generated step descriptors
encode 3,296-byte proofs without quotas and 3,456-byte proofs with quotas.
Four-worker observed proof p95 ranges from 391.7 to 1,378.1 ms; separate one-key
kernel peak RSS ranges from 46.50 to 169.16 MiB. These are captured-binary step
diagnostics, not durable-payment latency, complete-catalog or phone results.
The broad wrapper retains its source-drift failure from the concurrent merge;
the binary and measurement tools remained unchanged. Original samples and
descriptor/key digests are under
`target/qualification/monetary-selectors-capture-1/runtime-1`; its
`selector-summary.json` pins each process result. Three measurement helper tests
pass, and selected-package strict Clippy with `--no-deps` passes. The ordinary
strict command still fails on the 570 gadget dependency diagnostics; fixes are
staged separately from the active measurement sources.

The revised measurement harness passes 114 focused tests. It binds the complete
local package inputs, actual compiler depfiles, selected Rust tools, and both
present and absent Cargo configuration files in checkout ancestors and
`CARGO_HOME`. Unqualified compiler/wrapper overrides, configuration includes,
injected configuration environment, unavailable inputs and probe failures refuse
qualification. This is a local input and tool policy, not a hermetic operating
system claim. Fresh preparation succeeds with 2,022 bound inputs across 20 local
package roots and 23 actual compiler depfiles. Independent preflight confirms
unchanged before/after inputs and the selected executable. The nine-process,
three-block campaign under seed 20261008 stopped on a hard failure.
All four A configurations (synthetic and real chips, with one and four workers)
have completed nine valid processes with passing verdicts. The real A
one-worker block medians are 31.107561, 30.902561 and 31.939405 seconds of CPU
time; its six invalid attempts remain recorded. The real Q four-worker
configuration failed on its seventh valid process: 10.630025916 seconds of
observed elapsed time exceeded the 10-second hard limit, with no invalidity
reasons. The other three Q configurations are incomplete. No retry or
replacement sample changes that failure. Memory
compression invalidates an attempt even when its two proofs verify. The first
real-chip Q one-worker block has a 27.049123-second CPU median: all three runs
meet the 30-second hard limit, but the median misses the required 27-second
margin. The second real-chip Q four-worker block has a 9.420910083-second
elapsed median, inside the 10-second hard limit but outside the required
9-second margin. These block failures remain even if later blocks are faster.
Candidate,
preflight, raw attempts and the terminal failure are retained in
`target/qualification/m3-current-source-closure-candidate-20261008`. The source
closure and configuration repair records are retained in
`target/qualification/qualifier-source-closure` and
`qualifier-cargo-config-draft`.

The retirement/oracle/codec script selection passes 50 tests and 72 subtests.
The shipping oracle source check accepts rustfmt line wrapping while rejecting
conditional, commented-out and macro-contained assertions; actual oracle-enabled
compilation remains the semantic shipping gate. Initial false refusals and all
repair attempts are retained under `target/qualification/resume-20261008`.

The actual-workload advice scheduling diagnostic completes four correctness
processes and 24 timed processes with equal ordered commitments across both
schedules and worker counts. All three block pairs have valid environmental
observations. Serial submission regresses four-worker elapsed time by a median
factor of 3.07 for Q and 1.12 for A, so production keeps the existing schedule.
The exact binary, source review and every observation are retained in
`target/qualification/advice-current-capture-20261008`. These are commitment
diagnostics, not full-proof or M3 gate results.

The fresh recovered finality snapshot independently rehashes all 5,004 retained
originals, including 4,990 descriptor/verifying-key files totalling 406,815,883
bytes. Its explicit recovered-DATA record preserves the stopped producer and
missing original compiler binary. It supplies no proving-key qualification,
completed graph or wallet admission. The snapshot and independent review are in
`target/qualification/canonical-finality-recovered-metadata-1` and
`canonical-finality-recovered-metadata-review-1`.

The optimized per-use artifact capture completes successfully. Independent
review binds its three retained test executables to 78 emitted compiler
depfiles, 3,651 ordinary source inputs, 67 local packages and 9,383 unchanged
package files. All three generated inputs are reproduced exactly from the
captured IVM and bridge generators; the bridge selects no installed runtime
authority. The 20 changing files are outside the compiled packages and declared
generator inputs. The original broad source-drift classification is preserved,
with the narrower review retained separately under
`target/qualification/finality-per-use-compiler-capture-1`.
Its focused catalog/server/import selection passes 41 cases, including genuine
both-curve cache proofs, exact regeneration after eviction, a real k16 original
key import comparison, and recovered descriptor/key intake without reading or
generating proving keys. Thirteen artifact-dependent cases remain ignored in
those ordinary selections. The new complete52 run uses the independently
reviewed binary and recovered originals, with its attempts retained at
`target/qualification/canonical-complete52-per-use-1`. It has not produced a
completed authenticated wallet catalog or a monetary acceptance result.

**Artifact build-order correction.** `OwnPolicy` and `BootstrapPolicy` now fix
only the independently selected provider and root key. They bind scheme identity
from the constrained state/statement/lineage and signed objects, as required by
the [acyclic build order](kagemusha_lambda_omega_v1.md#24-verifying-keys-without-a-cycle-pipa-s14).
The former scheme constants created a key→relation→scheme→key cycle. Captures
below that used those constants remain scoped to their recorded source; fresh
affected A/W/Ω keys, a complete authenticated catalog and proof qualification
are required. No older-key compatibility path is installed.
The corrected Bootstrap regression passes 1/1 in 289.24 s: two genuine
sigma/Q/A1/W/A2 chains with distinct carried SchemeIDs have identical six
source VK byte strings, descriptors and known/unknown layouts. A third chain
uses genuinely signed foreign-scheme certificate originals and rejects at A2
after actual sigma/Q/A1/W proofs. The administrative sigma suite passes 8/8
in 19.01 s; own-scope constraints and fixed-layout mutations pass 2/2 in 12.13 s.
Exact binaries, source snapshots and logs are retained under
`target/qualification/bootstrap-carried-scheme`; the only build-source drift
was an `OwnPolicy` comment change. These component checks do not qualify the
corrected Omega catalog, installed wallet or performance gates.

| Milestone | Current evidence | Remaining boundary |
|---|---|---|
| G1 revision-4 σ and controls | Native proof crate release suite: 90 passed, 41 intentionally ignored; statement gadget 5 unit and 8 integration cases passed. Shared Rust vectors, all 8 Send masks and both Receive selectors are pinned. Fixed64 usage, recorded blacklist, share expiry and time-span checks have negative tests. Real k14 proofs for masks 2 and 7 verify at 3,456 B; other descriptor lengths are 3,296 B at k12. | The same suite and real k12/k14 cases pass after PIPA-R migration. Authenticated artifacts, cross-language rebuilt consumers and exhaustive ignored sweeps remain open. Native wallet preparation, verification and folding consume σ through the installed source owners. Acceptance under the complete authenticated 52-route catalog remains open; the component results do not establish that release boundary. |
| Envelope arithmetic | Canonical fixed Payment overhead is 1,723 B; largest current σ_send is 3,456 B, leaving at most 4,821 B for Ω. The earlier 4,736 B Ω was an estimate, not an implemented proof. The first generic Ω frame descriptor requires 11,392 B transport; bounded foreign arithmetic and direct S6 reduce it to 10,944 B. | Both generic Ω descriptors fail the hard cap. Compact layout work remains necessary. Actual complete Norito Payment/Status encodings must establish frozen bounds; no stand-in proof establishes a completed payment. |
| M3b carry/range binding | [Carry memo](kagemusha_ff_carry_v1.md) includes the four corrections, independent exact rederivation and reviewed source hashes. FF 20 existing plus 2 boundary tests and 4 shared-Q-layout tests passed. | Scoped engineering review, not an external cryptographic audit or proof-engine qualification. |
| M3 consuming witness / MSM budget | The prover consumes witnesses, releases lookup/quotient evaluations after their last use, and shares nonblocking process-wide MSM reservations across both Pasta kernels and complete-MSM callers. The 64 MiB MSM ceiling is unchanged. Its caller-owned quotient workspace reuses field columns and wipes every retained row on success, error and unwind. The current prepared-coset implementation fills one shared powers column per coset only when at least one owned FFT is needed; that column is charged to the same explicit workspace ceiling. Cached fixed-only keys retain zero field scratch. MSM reduction uses exact complete-curve gap weighting for sparse windows and linear summation at density at least one occupied position per 32. Affine and overflow occupancy both count; every lower position keeps its original weight. Independent review accepted the algebra, existing variable-time scope and unchanged scratch reservation. Full-width secret planning, constant-time secret inversion and buffer clearing are preserved. The integrated cancellation engine with shared public parameter tables passes **92 Pasta units**, **250 Plonk units** (one explicit ignored case and three timing/working-set cases excluded), and **45 independent native/vendored non-measurement oracle tests**, including proof-byte parity and mutation cases. The latter includes 37 ordinary cases and all eight intentionally ignored non-timing golden cases; its sole timing case remains excluded. The same 45 cases also pass in a captured x86_64 Mach-O executable under Rosetta (37 ordinary and eight non-timing ignored cases). Actual Cargo dep-info binds 2,762 consumed inputs, with no source/tool drift through execution; binary SHA `770b6200da9ca901877fde7bbd60880b79ead7e57a376eb6c0dbbc74ab742789` and the earlier missing-spec-input refusal are retained in `target/qualification/oracle-x86-rosetta`. This is emulated x86 instruction-path parity, not physical x86 timing or device qualification. Both instruction targets additionally pass all **73 companion oracle tests**: library 18, curve/parameter/FFT/MSM parity 37, KATs 13 and constraint systems 5, including every ignored large correctness case and k15/k16 parameter vector. Actual compiler and runtime inputs and tools remain unchanged; the x86 companion receipt separately records the non-consumed README update during execution. Records are retained at `target/qualification/oracle-m1a-current/{arm,x86}/summary.json`. A further independently reviewed succinct corpus passes four live-original oracle tests and two native-only replay tests on both ARM and compiled x86 under Rosetta, covering eight Sigma/Wide cases, all challenges, exact G/xi, final decisions and 40 mutations. Both captures have zero consumed source/tool/runtime drift (`target/qualification/snark-succinct-parity/{arm-tape,x86-tape}`); strict lint passes. The frozen native replay remains usable after oracle deletion. The original invalid-equation panic and trailing-prefix acceptance remain explicit observations, while native mutations reject normally. This does not claim parity of the distinct PIPA-AS fold transcript or the current full KAGEMUSHA catalog. The new path-filtered CI job requires all five actual compiled harnesses, active oracle-mode cases, complete nonempty pass counts and zero ignored correctness tests; the named timing measurement and maintenance-only reference-fixture printer are excluded, and hosted CI execution remains unobserved. Private IPA generator tables now use immutable shared ownership, so cloning parameters retains their public points without duplicating either table. Independent decoding still validates every point and allocates separate tables; no global cache, mutable table access or interning of untrusted inputs is introduced. Independent review and both-curve tests cover clone lifetime, exact serialized bytes, and malformed points at every encoded position. Initial Vec-to-Arc conversion may allocate; this change alone establishes no peak-RSS or timing improvement. All-target Pasta/Plonk strict Clippy passes. Explicit operation tokens now reach synthesis, original-key loading, commitment kernels, quotient construction, IPA, complete verification and native recursive decisions. Rayon work joins before cancellation returns; secret polynomials, blind arrays, canonical lookup-key buffers and leased quotient columns are guarded across early returns. Cancellation remains a typed hard result and cannot authorize a burn or correction. Actual cancellation/retry tests cover both curves, 1/4-worker proving, scratch release, witness assignment that flattens inner errors, fresh transcript/randomness and exact retry bytes. Both-curve tests cover empty/neighboring windows, sparse overflow-only cancellation, identity running sums, both sides of the exact density cutoff, positional weighting, negative centered carries and the randomized GLV/unsigned verifier-MSM comparison. Large polynomial evaluation uses fixed Horner subtrees, multiopen reconstructs disjoint coefficient blocks in unchanged slot order, and grand-product inversions use constant-time worker-sized batches with total scratch no larger than the original column. New tests compare both fields on 1/4 workers across empty, threshold and odd-sized inputs, zeros and negative challenges. Focused all-target Pasta/Plonk strict Clippy also passes for this engine. Actual fixed-only proofs cover eager zero-buffer and OnDemand two-column storage, exact one-byte-short refusal, both curves, and 1/4/1 worker reuse. Independent k13 comparisons exercise the parallel branches inside complete proofs on both curves and 1/4 workers: all 4,064 bytes match the vendored prover and both complete verifiers accept them. Existing owned/borrowed, row-wise quotient and transcript/RNG parity cases also pass. The subsequent four-row evaluator candidate preserves node/constraint order and reserves at most16MiB extra scratch through the same64MiB process budget, with immediate scalar fallback. Its normal binary passes261 ordinary tests plus the explicit large GLV case; strict Plonk lib/tests Clippy passes. Its independently captured oracle binary passes42 ordinary and eight explicit large correctness cases, including complete proof-byte equality, verification and mutations. Consumed build sources/tools and runtime sources/binary are unchanged. The retained wrapper initially rejected its stale expected counts and included one maintenance printer; `target/qualification/quotient-tiles-oracle-capture-1/oracle-runtime/count-scope-review.json` records the actual compiled inventory and excludes that extra maintenance case from the50 correctness passes. The interrupted eight-configuration M3 campaign is no longer running and its directory is unavailable; no completed qualification is established. The corrected harness prospectively binds the specified memory-activity policy, requires a fresh candidate/schedule and preserves recorded invalidity and hard failures. Its114 script tests pass after the local source-closure and Cargo-configuration repairs. Microkernel speedups and correctness passes do not qualify the M3 gate. Current original-checkout shared-table commands, results, retained binary hashes and source observations are in `target/qualification/params-arc-sharing/correctness-observed.json` (1,623 selected engine/oracle source and Cargo inputs unchanged); the earlier cancellation integration evidence remains in `target/qualification/prover-cancellation-integration/correctness-observed.json`; earlier immutable pre-cancellation captures remain separately retained under `m3-msm-gap-production`. Earlier captured independent-caller and complete-MSM contention tests establish the existing shared budget mechanism; these component correctness results do not establish a timing or phone pass. | All eight synthetic/real Q/A worker configurations require nine valid fresh processes in three blocks. The sparse-window candidate is **superseded/incomplete/inconclusive**, with binary SHA `57bb694fa697493201bd6bda82acfc7c2556f695a4651cabcc1ca3d16f251aaa` and source SHA `b1db82c35b1e392795b20724ef0ce0d3057363b6684e18152a90ffd64624c831`. Completed first-block real Q4/A1 medians are **9.664976959 s elapsed / 33.664216 s CPU**, above the required 9/32.4 s margins despite meeting hard limits. Real A4 retains three valid processes from ten attempts: median **10.167093875 s**, maximum **11.784894917 s** below 12 s, and peak **834,682,880 B**. Synthetic A4 has three valid processes with median **8.761906417 s**. Real Q1 has one valid **29.300507 s CPU** process, above the 27 s margin but below 30 s; subsequent memory-pressure/compression/pageout brackets are invalid and remain retained. The retained ledger, exact candidate, both proofs per process, calibrations and recomputed terminal summary are in `target/qualification/m3-component-20261007-msm-gaps-current-lock`; no partial configuration is a qualification pass. Its predecessor gap capture was invalidated by recorded lockfile drift. Earlier completed candidates retain hard failures: parallel polynomials Q1 **30.013863 s CPU** against 30 s; prepared cosets Q4 **12.266209583 s** against 10 s; empty-prefix Q4 **10.107276125 s** against 10 s. Their raw valid/invalid samples, exact binaries and terminal verdicts remain under the corresponding `m3-component-20261007-*` directories. The batched-FFT capture is separately **interrupted/inconclusive**, with no surviving runner and an incomplete final calibration bracket. Hard limits, the 10% time margin and 5% memory margin remain unchanged. The runner stopped naturally at Q1 attempt15 when its post-attempt provenance check observed the genuine cancellation integration; that attempt also retained invalid host-pressure readings. `superseded-capture.json` records the refusal without turning it into a valid hard failure or a pass. The newly integrated cancellation engine has the scoped correctness evidence in this row; all eight performance configurations still require qualification under the unchanged accepted method. Physical-phone results remain separate. |
| Independent full-proof reference | The standard-library Python verifier derives complete PLONK, multiopen and IPA equations from the specification and independently decides the generator. All **46 genuine proofs** pass across both Pasta curves, three transcript profiles and ten pinned parameter sets at k6–k10. The final adversarial suite passes **169/169** in 114.22 s with unchanged verifier/test/fixture hashes, including exact parser and instance shapes, parameter/descriptor identities, typed-instance boundaries, metadata aliases and six constructive false claims that preserve the soft IPA equation but fail generator decision. Independent read-only mathematical/parser review accepted the final scoped implementation. A fresh original-checkout Rust oracle recomputes the complete frozen fixture exactly: **1/1** in 9.99 s, executable `ecc02d13…894b9a`, 2,743 actual compiler inputs and zero source/tool/runtime drift (`target/qualification/python-reference/current2/runtime-observed.json`). Strict oracle fixture lint and all ten CI admission/shipping-source tests pass. The frozen fixture SHA is `6a3e07aeec1c7bdaef42ca3cd72771fee90cbe38e681ac48cd3b38e7e4384e55`. CI requires the genuine fixture comparison, isolated standard-library replay and adversarial suite. | Individual proofs and canonical generator claims only: no batch-weight, encoded-accumulator, k16, recursive PIPA-AS, full-catalog or physical-phone qualification. No production fallback decoder is added. Hosted CI execution remains unobserved; vendor/oracle retirement still requires every remaining M7 gate. |
| Retained native consumers | SoraFS PoP uses native PIPA-R with consuming witnesses, full opening verification and new pinned circuit/key identities. All 38 proof and 25 Node PoP consumer tests pass; canonical fixtures, signed inventory and strict lint pass. Native Kaigi passes 23 library tests, seven Core_zk Kaigi tests, two descriptor/key-carrier tests and 48 verifier/admission/guardrail tests. Both libraries now generate unchanged RP56 parameters with native Grain and compare all 201 field elements against dev-only independent oracles. Their normal dependency graphs contain no `poseidon-primitives`; the immutable 23/38-case capture has no source/binary drift (`target/qualification/retained-rp56-native-20261007`). Focused all-target strict Clippy passes; the dependency-inclusive run retains 570 existing gadget diagnostics. The rebuilt JavaScript host passes all 22 Kaigi tests. All three rebuilt Core Kaigi lifecycle/admission integration tests pass. The rebuilt Core real-proof release builder and native policy/gas/guardrail components pass; current Torii native-policy, exact-identity, allowlist and KAGEMUSHA route/finality tests pass. The key carrier binds the complete compiled descriptor and processed Vesta key; old keys and labels reject. The native development vote fixture passes reproducibility and adversarial checks; the native confidential host hash passes 35 regression tests. The confidential production implementation now uses consuming native PIPA-R with three new exact circuit/key identities and one native public column. Its activated Rust confidential suite passes 50 tests, including all three production-depth real proofs at 3,680 B each; the independent relation corpus passes ten host/adversarial cases. The first-release engine retirement is now installed: only Native PIPA-R=0 and STARK=1 remain, with seven exact registry profiles; the generic Halo2 parser, dispatch, key reader, runtime configuration selectors and obsolete fixtures are deleted. Current Core_zk/IVM test targets compile. Focused current SDK checks pass: Kotlin registry/model/Java consumers 53, C# registry 96, Python confidential/client/registry 262, isolated Swift registry 10 and JavaScript OpenVerify codec 4. The retained RAM-LFE circuit corpus is ported to the native engine. All ten native Poseidon tests pass, including genuine proofs at ordinary and maximum inputs plus round/S-box/copy/padding attacks. The complete first run passed 26 cases and found a stale degree11/20 key expectation; the corrected byte suite proves degrees5/8/9 and rejects the larger degrees under the unchanged cap. The old test adapter and its vendored dev-dependencies are deleted; the complete rebuilt 27-case corpus passes. The original 218-case both-field Poseidon oracle corpus is captured and passes native replay plus independent Python rederivation and six mutation controls. All eleven shared-backend inventory checks and the three retirement source guards pass. The actual rebuilt JavaScript confidential addon passes six original nonskipping tests; the installed sealed Python wheels pass all five original nonskipping native wallet tests (150.88 s), including full-65,536-tree proofs, change redemption, adversarial rejection and GIL progress. Python installed admission passes before and after execution. The source-admitted ABI-26 CloseLoads host passes the combined C# suite **536/536**, zero failed/skipped/not-run (592.36 s): 482 registry/query/event/receipt cases, seven managed owner cases, six native confidential cases and 41 Kaigi cases. Real native cases cover both full-tree evidence formats, retained change redemption, owner disposal and invalid inputs. The matching original-source Swift package passes 133/133 cases (19 confidential, 114 wallet/load/platform/vectors), with unchanged SDK sources and producer pins; actual JNI and managed wallet suites pass 4/4 and 86/86. Runtime observation confirms the exact `3b51ff55…` dylib; selected source and binary pins have zero drift. Original logs, wheel and host receipts, source manifests and earlier natural failures remain under `target/qualification/native-sdk/{python-current-source,csharp-native-migration}`. These are captured local native component results; subsequent source edits, installed release-package admission and physical devices remain outside their scope. | Packaged SDK and network qualification and final consumer execution remain open; shared vendor dependencies and the temporary oracle cannot yet be removed. The rebuilt full Core_zk library baseline finished with 489 passing tests and two stale negative expectations; both expectations are repaired and all seven focused verifier tests pass. JavaScript registry tests reject the stale native artifact source fingerprint. Kotlin client baseline tests passed 33/93; native address validation requires a rebuilt source-admitted ABI-26 artifact; earlier ABI-25 captures are historical. The registry fixture has now been regenerated by Rust: its canonical 182-byte native instruction matches Kotlin byte for byte. Its status field is the canonical u32 enum payload; the inconsistent one-byte Rust slice decoder and SDK encoder are removed. These are not qualification passes. The reviewed dependency-budget baseline includes the promoted native confidential dependencies and passes; the release source seal predates substantial concurrent work and still fails, so release packaging is not qualified. An attempted broad C# run (the MTP runner ignored its filter) failed 1,518 of 3,595 tests; inspected failures include the unavailable rebuilt native address validator. The correctly filtered source-level tests above do not establish native SDK qualification. |
| Measurement controls | Fallible direct CPU/kernel RSS probes; verified 1/4-worker pools; two separately verified owned-witness proofs; source/binary and actual descriptor binding. All 75 Python runner tests pass with Python 3.12 and the pinned script dependencies. The candidate binds the prospective memory-activity policy; changed policy requires a fresh schedule and preserves previously recorded invalid attempts. The ledger retains and rechecks raw output, process exits, environmental probes, both calibrations, candidate boundaries and declared execution order, including the 18-attempt ceiling. Descriptor inventory must retain the completed build's executable hash. Component preparation derives local dependency roots and cross-crate inputs from actual Cargo artifacts and depfiles, binds Cargo/toolchain/build inputs, and rejects in-scope source drift while separately recording whole-checkout changes. Missing probes, launch failures, altered calibration and scoped source drift invalidate retained attempts. RSS headroom uses each block median while every valid process must meet the hard cap. CLI run/summary returns failure for failed, borderline or inconclusive qualification. The current driver retains a caller-owned quotient workspace with a 256 MiB field-buffer ceiling across both proofs; reports must show empty initial storage and exact reuse on the second proof. Its allocation is included in kernel RSS, with no adjustment to the hard RSS or MSM limits. | All eight synthetic/chip-filled Q/A worker configurations still require the complete nine-process, three-block qualification. The DAG-release component retained three invalid Q four-worker attempts, then a valid calibrated hard failure: slower proof 35.1231 s observed elapsed against 10 s, kernel peak 722,059,264 B, both 7,936 B proofs verified (`target/qualification/m3-component-20261007-dag-release`). The canonical-key candidate has unchanged workload descriptors and a stable 1,998-file compiled dependency scope. Under the same predeclared seed 20261007 it retains four invalid calibration brackets, followed by a valid Q four-worker hard failure: slower observed elapsed 21.1679 s against 10 s, kernel peak 728,170,496 B, both 7,936 B proofs verified. Its binary SHA is `362e2ca429ead3253d7945b3d11c8203528b7ea4c95c275487dbc7f6988f09fb`; source/build/raw-attempt/summary evidence is retained in `target/qualification/m3-component-20261007-canonical-lookup`. The configured early stop preserves this failed partial schedule; it cannot produce a pass for any incomplete configuration. The workspace candidate has the same four workload descriptors and stable 1,999-file dependency scope. Its Q four-worker configuration exhausted the declared 18-attempt ceiling with no valid calibration bracket and is inconclusive. The next scheduled A real-chip one-worker process had valid calibration but failed its CPU hard cap: 36.203590 s against 36 s, kernel peak 830,881,792 B within the 0.85 GiB cap, both 7,584 B proofs verified. The partial schedule stopped as declared; binary SHA `f7f6947efb876fa7709037c15f97ee8ab90d69abda0ca8e3a8ade8d353d37c70` and all evidence remain in `target/qualification/m3-component-20261007-workspace`. The per-column workspace candidate retains the same four descriptors and stable 1,999-file scope. Its five invalid Q four-worker brackets were followed by a valid hard failure: slower observed elapsed 19.701137292 s against 10 s and kernel peak 814,596,096 B against 805,306,368 B, with both 7,936 B proofs verified. The declared early stop preserves this failed partial schedule; binary SHA `8926d09d25c6460c7cf42700e8850827949be4bd3b367716889319b2a853189d` and raw/source/summary evidence are in `target/qualification/m3-component-20261007-columns`. The streamed lookup candidate has unchanged descriptor digests and layout records, with binary SHA `a5d2e1577d7212bc441f9152523343a7864497f44b52540c1b8d20ca554f24ac`. Its five invalid brackets and three valid processes are retained in `target/qualification/m3-component-20261007-streamed-lookups`. Valid slower times are 9.721029833/9.651365542/14.434622416 s; the last fails 10 s and ends the partial schedule. Valid kernel peaks are 785,907,712/667,402,240/725,827,584 B, all within 805,306,368 B. The first block RSS median 725,827,584 B meets its headroom target; its time median 9.721029833 s misses the 9 s target. Every valid-process proof verifies at 7,936 B. Neither the nine-process Q configuration nor the other seven configurations is qualified. Invalid attempts remain recorded; elapsed-time failures are never normalized. Component results do not qualify a frozen whole-release candidate or a phone. |
| PIPA-R / recursion | Native PIPA-R typed transcripts/proofs and PIPA-AS folds pass both-curve tests. The complete succinct circuit interpreter matches real source proofs. Total soft accumulator decoding, malformed-claim → burn → Trivial replacement → hard fold, and exceptional identity-correction rejection pass on both curves. Obligation tests cover the branch truth table and all 14 unsplit schedules, with four fixed Vesta fold slots including explicit trivial fillers. The [soundness argument](kagemusha_recursion_soundness_v1.md) records assumptions and outstanding review. | A genuine Q → A → Ω composition, full key continuity, operation relations and recursive mutations remain open. Component proofs do not establish unbounded-PCD soundness or a joint simulator. |
| Q signature relation | Five integration tests pass for exact ten-word slot binding, fixed/variable keys, malformed raw256 inputs, low-S and verdict rules, and witness-independent layout. The 5V/1F shape reaches 64,238 rows / 747,364 cells. A real one-slot native proof is 8,576 B and its opening decides. Raw256 bridge cell tampering and shared-table audits pass. | Signed-object semantics, issuer-role authorization and complete operation composition remain required. Q proofs are local, not the transported Ω. |
| Q sigma relation | Real Receive-k12 and incoming Send-k14 proofs are verified in Q with a hard three-slot local accumulation. The shared byte/ECC layout has 29 advice, 42 fixed, 22 equality columns and 12 lookups; largest row span 50,799 at k16. Its actual native Q proof is 10,496 B and verifies, with altered public chunks rejected. Native preparation binds exact proof lengths, class keys, selected claims and exported frames. | One four-worker synthesis/prove/self-verify diagnostic took 12.8297 s; this is neither an isolated proof timing nor qualification. Q is local, not the transported Omega proof. |
| Authenticated producer inventory | One canonical signed identity commits all16 sigma plus Omega verifier originals and the complete producer catalog. Its profile binds the compiled14-variant schedules, all52 logical selector routes, six finality source-class schedules, all16 fixed sigma recipes and the162-byte compiled compact Omega recipe. The current14,513-byte profile matches an independently framed preimage. Bounded content-addressed readers check exact lengths/hashes before source import; verifier-only reads never request PKs. Public sigma qualification passes actual16-source original imports and foreign-selector/changed-PK cases (23.32 s, `target/qualification/native-sigma-source-qualification`); Q qualification passes actual signed Bootstrap Q0/Q1 plus root, hard/soft, manifest and truncated-original mutations (60.50 s, `native-q-source-qualification`). Shared source factories pass seven captured cases (`native-q-source-factories/results.json`). The current immutable Core capture passes17 artifact namespace cases with6explicit expensive ignores (3.44 s), actual signed Bootstrap Q/A1/W0/A2 public-route qualification (267.84 s), and actual Retiring2Q/4A/3W public-route qualification (309.06 s), including signed context mutations, old-manifest refusal before storage and incomplete final-Omega rejection (`target/qualification/native-route-omega-qualification`, zero recorded source drift). Retiring deliberately uses an unqualified candidate Omega. The implemented all-route qualifier reconstructs complete native context and imports each original in sequence; final Omega qualification requires every logical route, exact common predecessor identity and full terminal D+VK deduplication in signed program order before canonical source import. The offline compiler shares raw source recipes without qualified markers or placeholder signatures. The prior-anchor engineering run completes all52 operation walks and retains1,033 originals, then fails final Omega with `Source(OmegaLayout)` after10,972.91s; no complete grant is produced. Diagnosis finds a catalog-wide linear sum passed to a three-term primitive. The local catalog selector now chains bounded sums while preserving the one-to-three-key layout. Four focused recursion cases and strict lint pass. The separate canonical-anchor finality-source job stopped without a terminal receipt; its surviving partial artifacts require exact source reconciliation before reuse. Earlier failed profile expectation and all previous captures remain retained at their linked qualification paths. | Signatures or individual source owners grant no complete wallet capability. The complete source-qualified route/catalog closure, actual transport/latency/memory gates and NativeProofs orchestration remain open. The independently selected global genesis and exact receipt wrapper must bind the Load dependency. No wallet-open capability is granted by these component checks. |
| A / Ω recursive frames | All 14 A variants share the tested 69-field frame. Same-tape statement/message mutations and isolated source k12/k14/k16 Ω frames pass. The captured witnessed-key Tagged3 Bootstrap/Load/Send-mask0 component catalog was rebuilt under its actual common Ω digest with exact source-descriptor and key equality; all three genuine outer proofs verify and their complete claims decide in that captured source. Source A proofs are 7,744 B. The complete Send chain binds current Credential, direct Enrollment certificate and Receipt, full 320-byte predecessor public transcript plus proof/P/V/σ digest, pending/fee/unchanged maps and every opening. Stage/task omission, receipt substitution and internal-key misuse reject. | The complete source-qualified release terminal catalog over every required selector route, enabled Send masks, remaining operation composition and final authenticated rooted artifacts remain open; its distinct key count is not assumed from the 14 semantic variants. The historical witnessed-key three-terminal result below is 4,800 B per transport under the unchanged 4,821 B cap. The canonical native source pins its installed catalog into the circuit. The captured native-pinned Receive-catalog test passes1/1 in7,069.43 s: rebuilt Bootstrap, Load and Receive share one immutable three-terminal key, each3,712 B raw/4,800 B transport. It checks exact planned/actual terminal VK, all four real fold inputs and their decisions, dropped-fourth rejection, retained-credit membership, strict original import and canonical checkpoint replay (`target/qualification/kagemusha-receive/pinned-omega-accept/run.log`). This remains a captured pre-O(1) component result with superseded voucher-Load ancestry; the current source rekey, ordinary-finality fixture and full release catalog remain open. Descriptor equality does not establish source equality or transfer the old size result. Installed native Bootstrap/Load/Send component differential results are scoped to their captured Tagged3 sources. Current Bootstrap replaces eager PK retention with shared verifier metadata, strict per-role original imports and one borrowed PK per proof; Bootstrap/Refresh consumer compilation passes, and captured Bootstrap exact-proof/checkpoint replay passes1/1 in1,359.45 s (`native-bootstrap-borrowed*`), including all three exact proof byte strings, foreign borrowed keys, source/table/VK/profile mutations and canonical restoration. Metadata construction is not catalog authority and does not establish a memory gate. Current Load also retains only nine descriptor/VK identities and strictly imports one borrowed PK per stage. Its six unit cases and actual five-A/four-W source import regression pass (117.29 s), including changed genesis, foreign-stage originals and the fifth-terminal checkpoint boundary; captured A rows are 53,354/61,436/60,868/55,352/56,016 (`target/qualification/native-load-borrowed`). This is witnessless source/import evidence, not a finalized funding proof. Send now uses the same metadata-only/per-stage borrowed-key ownership without changing its fixed schedules or controls; the current proof library and consuming integration targets compile; genuine proof replay requires an ordinary-finality recursive-Load fixture. Descriptor `4c9ed1f762bbad39623dd865a5c72876d5482d1ddf20bf15f6facf3259d9233b` is a source candidate, not a frozen catalog or qualified timing result. Frame fixtures alone do not authorize operations. |
| Fixed-stage continuation context | All staged producers now commit the complete immutable operation context once as C, then bind C, the fixed internal ordinal and current full-k16 Pallas claim under kgwlink1. The immediately preceding exact W key and unchanged P/V folds preserve all prior obligations; historical hash replay, its helper and private trace copies are removed. Independent local review found no context or obligation gap. The current proof library and every integration target compile. A strict native/circuit mutation test passes (86.93s): all nine internal Archive ordinals match the independent formula, have identical assignment extents, preserve known/unknown layout and reject changed context, point, every challenge limb, variant, stage, short source and terminal/overflow ordinals. The captured executable and source subset are retained in `target/qualification/archive-constant-context`. The subsequent native namespace passes77 tests and its independent stage-link framing check passes. Explicit incoming message projections use two exact128-bit halves; the72.24s strict encoding regression and independent review preserve all original bits, including malformed encodings (`archive-two-half-context`). | Every staged source key changes. Earlier actual-proof results below remain tied to their captured pre-change executables. Fresh actual proofs, strict original imports, final catalog closure and performance qualification remain required. |
| Ordinary-finality source artifacts | The offline compiler and import-only native graph share six fixed source factories, emit one source at a time, and strictly reimport originals. Canonical directory inventories enforce exact identities, finite lengths/totals and integrity without granting installation authority. Four storage tests and shared-class layout samples pass. Historical unbatched captures retain the genuine Genesis source/wrapper proof and mutations (105.24 s), twelve initial source/wrapper imports across all six programs (126.70 s), and the 1,139-class synthesis sweep; those are superseded source evidence, not current graph qualification. The current Context source pairs CRC/Blake transitions into 1,281 leaves ending at semantic position 2,561: three actual class source/wrapper/import cases pass (273.62 s), alongside five original strict cases (55.63 s). BLS now uses 542 exact two-step classes ending at 1,084: four actual source/wrapper/import cases pass (234.52 s), and the complete strict trace passes (829.15 s). Result now uses 258 batches ending at 515: three actual class source/wrapper/import cases pass (208.18 s). All 598 current unique classes synthesize at k16 (15.57 s). Captures are under `target/qualification/finality-{context-batches,bls-pairs,result-pairs}/original-proofs`; the complete Result short/maximum strict trace also passes (763.33 s), covering all 258 batches and all 515 original semantics. Exact ContextHashInput reuse re-verifies the installed proof and both claims before both schedule compositions consume it; input/endpoint mutation tests and independent source reviews found no local binding gap. The compiled graph requires 14,066 invocations before exact-context reuse, or 8,944 when that reuse applies; these are structural counts, not time or memory measurements. The genuine constructor-anchor Genesis checkpoint test passes (57.30 s), rejecting all six endpoint/proof/P/V mutations (`finality-resumable-driver`). The streaming original backend passes actual eviction/regeneration, exact D/VK/hash preservation, strict reimport/proving/full verification and restart recompilation with a 128 MiB PK disk ceiling (84.22 s; `finality-streaming-genuine`). This bounds disk custody, not process RSS. The new wallet verifier-only qualifier compiles and shares the exact graph assembler; it rederives sealed-source VKs and pinned wrappers, compares every bounded original D/VK and consumes the complete metadata inventory without accessing server PKs. Actual Genesis and shared Genesis/Append wrapper parity against strict original-PK imports passes2/2 in55.50 s, with zero PK reads and descriptor/VK/anchor/bounds/original mutations (`target/qualification/finality-verifier-only`). Five concurrent checkpoint/streaming lint-only source changes are recorded; the qualifier and shared assembler were unchanged. A fresh actual verifier-only regression also passes67.39 s with all six receipt endpoints, changed digest and canonical-endpoint empty-proof refusal (`target/qualification/native-q-source-factories/finality-actual-verifier-only.log`). Complete graph qualification of that path remains pending. The first complete ordinary-finality → Load run is active from immutable executable `52d7d2e5…`; source/import preflight and all five A/four W original imports pass (108.15 s), while the 8,944-proof graph is still compiling its offline source inventory (`target/qualification/ordinary-first-load-full/run.log`). The 512 MiB resident-PK cache limit is a configured storage bound, not a measured process-memory pass. The bounded receipt-reuse loader passes seven default cases (3.95 s) and strict lint (7.00 s), checking exact producer/source/fixture/inventory pins and original bounds (`target/qualification/finality-receipt-restore/current`); actual complete receipt restoration awaits the live graph. Earlier large-file diagnostic refusals and scoped offline read caps remain retained in `target/qualification/finality-offline-catalog/results.json`; the codec retirement guard passes. | Complete program/wrapper/merge/composition import, actual reused-proof semantic closure, the ordinary-finality Load fixture and authenticated deployment remain open. Source synthesis, constructor-anchor Genesis, fewer invocations and large-file read caps do not establish finality, production RSS, timing or phone compliance. |
| Compact Ω layout | The captured guarded secondary-range candidate produces and natively verifies an actual **3,712 B PIPA-R proof / 4,800 B transport** at k16, degree 9, exactly one lookup, 11 advice columns, 25 advice queries, 12 fixed queries and six equality columns. The authentic full-C4 Q2/tagged-A3 Bootstrap source is used. Witnessed-key and pinned-one-key cases pass complete predicates, known/unknown fixed/permutation/assignment equality and native opening decisions. The rooted single-terminal construction then rebuilds every signed object, sigma, Q and A/W proof under the actual compact Ω digest; exact source and outer VK bytes remain unchanged and both accumulators decide. The standalone rooted test passed 1/1 (`target/qualification/rooted-compact-bootstrap.log`, 384.49 s busy-host component run). The captured witnessed-key catalog run reproduces this rooted construction with 65,458 primary range rows, then completes **common two-terminal Bootstrap/Load and three-terminal Bootstrap/Load/Send-mask0 catalogs**: each signed source chain is rebuilt under its shared key before proving; exact terminal VK bytes and the common outer VK remain unchanged; all three 3,712-byte outer proofs verify and every modified public-column case rejects. The common schedules use 64,991 and 64,996 primary range rows respectively. The complete three-terminal run passes 1/1 in 2,754.43 s on this busy host; this is a component run, not a timing qualification. `target/qualification/compact-three-terminal-catalog-merged2.log` records `COMPACT_TWO_TERMINAL_CLOSURE` and `COMPACT_THREE_TERMINAL_CLOSURE`; its source and binary provenance are retained in `target/qualification/compact-three-terminal-catalog-merged2-source.json`. The replay suite passes 5/5, including both native curves, exact source/cached-clone bindings, every meaningful cell mutation, missing/extra events and boundary/collision controls. The corrected 81/93-bit top gates reject coordinated overflow; the continuing duplex offset regression passes both fields. Source-coupled details and hashes are in the carry/compact record §28. The current compiled factory derives guarded k16 placement from unknown source metadata and pins its exact 162-byte policy preimage in the native profile. The merged native binary passes83 cases with three source-import sweeps explicitly ignored (`target/qualification/native-producer-merge-reconcile/captured-native`). The freshly rebuilt genuine rooted Bootstrap regression passes in289.54 s, reproducing exact descriptor/VK identity and strict original-PK import, then verifying3,712 B raw/4,800 B transport, both claims and public mutations. All recorded proof-source and copied-binary hashes remain unchanged (`target/qualification/merge-reconcile-root/fixture-capture`); executable SHA is `4947f8d9643fa8841d9a38631ec579bf3a4d4527e7775028dc7dbff1fd48f447`. Seven default Load/recovery/claim cases pass, with one expensive case ignored; the initial all-ignored Bootstrap invocation is retained separately and is not proof evidence. The seven reconciled fixture files retain all114 top-level builders/types/tests and20 direct test registrations, while shared fixture modules register none. All proof test targets compile and pass scoped strict lint. This is captured single-terminal evidence, not complete-catalog qualification. | **Historical component size/capacity and three-terminal key-continuity evidence only.** The current compact helper uses the canonical native pinned-catalog source, original-PK importer and canonical checkpoint replay. The captured native-source test completes the Bootstrap/Load/Receive three-terminal catalog and passes1/1 in7,069.43 s, each3,712 B raw/4,800 B transport, with actual common-key rebuilding, exact original import, canonical checkpoint replay, exact terminal VK, all four actual fold inputs and claim decisions, dropped-fourth rejection and retained-credit membership (`target/qualification/kagemusha-receive/pinned-omega-accept/run.log`). This captured pre-O(1) result does not qualify the subsequently changed staged sources or the complete release catalog. The earlier witnessed-key multi-terminal source is no longer the producer; matching descriptors alone cannot carry qualification across that change. These Load-derived chains use the superseded dedicated-publisher voucher trust model. Current native and recursive Load producers bind ordinary transaction receipts and compact finality. The integration helpers require genuine finality and original proving artifacts; the retired issuer fixture is removed. Installing the current fixture and rebuilding this catalog remain prerequisites for current-release qualification. The other seven Send masks and full allowed terminal catalog, every operation shape, adversarial recursive composition and loaded-host qualification remain open. No transport admission or release artifact is frozen. Superseded profiles remain failed diagnostics: generic common Bootstrap/Load Ω transports 11,360 B; the prior 4,768 B compact descriptor failed range capacity at k16. Captured wire encoding tests pass 2/2. The regenerated-vector KAGEMUSHA data-model namespace passes 224 tests (two explicit maintenance captures ignored), including fixed frame-padding contracts, codecs, ordinary Load event inclusion, the native-captured receipt fixture and exact CreditedReceive overhead679/proof budget9,321 (`target/qualification/credited-receive-bounds/captured-kagemusha-namespace.log` and `captured-namespace-provenance.json`). The actual Rust generator emits fixture SHA `a584169008fb9ef1a41af50d4e523857acb2ff8f8999947386f74c8ee266fdf6`; its metadata delta also passes37 Kotlin tests and34 unchanged Swift wire/vector tests in an isolated pure component target. The earlier ABI25/21 mismatch and interrupted ordinary-Load rename build remain invalid historical attempts. The subsequent source-bound ABI25 host capture passes 123 Kotlin and 88 Swift cases, and the expanded data-model namespace passes 228 cases with two explicit maintenance ignores, each within its recorded component scope. Neither result requalifies these older recursive catalogs or establishes full SDK/phone acceptance. Fixed Payment overhead remains 1,723 B, and explicitly structural 3,456 B sigma / 4,800 B Omega bytes encode to 9,979 B. The current 4,821 B Omega allowance leaves 21 B for the captured 4,800 B component (`target/qualification/payment-current-encoding-size.log`). After the catalog selector repair, metadata synthesis for32 genuine retained same-descriptor terminal keys fits65,060 of65,530 usable k16 rows, and compiled secondary-range replay passes. Counts1/8/16/24/32 preserve the exact outer descriptor under the actual compiler configuration while their source fingerprints differ. Receipts, exact library/executable pins and root-manifest drift are retained in `target/qualification/omega-catalog-layout-diagnostic`. This is source-fit evidence, not authoritative terminal membership, a regenerated Omega key or a final proof. Actual complete-catalog proof acceptance and the complete10,000B release gate remain open. |
| Signed-object constraints | The captured 14-case object suite and three additional delivery-evidence cases pass for all 11 exact signed-body schemas against Rust vectors, same-tape message/object digests and Request credit ID; malformed fields/version/key framing; total credential evidence/policy and exact renewal continuity; Send/Receive receipt substitutions; policy/voucher body bounds; Request overflow/pair checks; exact basis-point rounding, clamps and overflow before clamping; exact Load voucher/wallet binding; Send payer ownership and head-held fees (including zero-fee defaults); original 163-byte Payment transcript and transitive package binding, with every byte and nested component substitution rejected; total credit-opening parsing and root/credit/Payment binding reject sentinel, alias, next-key, sibling and burn-flag substitutions. Total incoming statements match hard semantics across all 14 variants and every field, and malformed statements remain false even when the receipt digest is recomputed to match. Dynamic CreditStatus heads and receipts use one fixed layout across all operation tags. Both Credited transcript forms match Rust vectors; CreditStatus and Receive evidence bind the original Request, receiver wallet/key, pinned relation, credit/amount and retained Payment, with renewal preserved and coherent foreign-relation/root/Payment substitutions rejected. These tests hash the original malformed transcripts and reject forged true verdicts. Four current delivery-object tests additionally hard-bind canonical Status component addresses and Credited Payment/evidence preimages before soft semantics; substituted preimages reject under both proposed verdicts, while noncanonical original references remain false. Proof/signature decisions remain separate required obligations. The corrected Archive receiver binding uses Request credential field8 rather than certificate-set field17; canonical fixtures preserve distinct digests. Six focused status/delivery checks pass (61.79 s), including original-preimage rejection under both proposed verdicts. | Component tests. The Receive Objects producer additionally passes exact raw-tape, selector, owner/context/Q-export and joint-size tests at and one byte above the limit, including active-length aliases and known/unknown shape parity. Incoming σ digest/index/proof chunks are hard equalities; only the original statement and actual proof verdict remain soft. Other Receive producers and terminal closure remain in progress; a standalone parsed object is not authenticated. |
| Receive source provenance / authorization | The original Payment transcript now hard-binds Request, carried payer credential and package content addresses; Request hard-binds its quoted credential and certificate. Ordinary versus renewed is determined by that exact quoted/current digest equality. Six Receive component tests and three Payment differential/substitution tests pass: fixed-Payment auxiliary substitutions fail for either proposed verdict, while rebound invalid object versions remain total. The actual renewed incoming 3V1F signature-Q proof verifies at 7,936 B and 51,177 maximum rows; the real Receive/incoming-Send two-slot Q is 7,008 B with both 3,296-byte σ proofs and passes Accept/Trivial cases. A genuine k16 soft signature-Q proof, hard recursive extraction and exact receipt binding pass for both honest and r=0 signatures, with Accept/Trivial mode and message/key/signature/verdict/proof substitution controls. Earlier constant-size-context Bootstrap-only malformed-sigma Receive passes its complete10A/9W chain, all19 strict original imports, borrowed-key exact proof parity and canonical exact-byte checkpoint replays in a fresh session in2,045.12 s (`target/qualification/kagemusha-receive/o1-current/receive-run.log`): actual incoming Q soft-false, exact re-signed originals, allTrivial, unchanged consumed root and zero adjusted spendable value, with no Load dependency. All ten source layouts fit k16 with maximum65,305 rows under65,529; original/Q/context/current-P/W, foreign-session and malformed-custody substitutions reject. A separate pre-policy-correction Bootstrap-only malformed-sigma burn closes actual Ω in1,949.62 s (`target/qualification/kagemusha-receive/bootstrap-burn-omega-o1/run.log`): fresh immutable Bootstrap/Receive catalog rebuild, exact planned terminal VK, all19 original imports and native exact-byte replays,3,712 B proof/4,800 B transport, allfour canonical obligations deciding, droppedfourth rejection and retained burned-credit membership, with no Load ancestry. The corrected carried-scheme Bootstrap-only malformed-sigma Receive→Ω now passes1/1 in1,614.99 s (`target/qualification/kagemusha-receive/bootstrap-burn-omega-carried-scheme`, binary `eeff209e…44c32`): all10A/9W, all19 strict original imports, borrowed-key proof-byte parity, exact canonical checkpoints in a fresh session, maximum65,305 source rows, actual Trivial burn with zero adjusted spendable value and no Load ancestry. Its fresh immutable two-terminal native catalog preserves the exact terminal VK; Ω is3,712 B/4,800 B transport, allfour obligations decide and dropping the fourth rejects. The only build drift is unrelated finality metadata, retained with both source snapshots. Captured accepted Receive also closes actual Ω under an immutable common Bootstrap/Load/Receive key:3,712 B proof/4,800 B transport, exact planned terminal VK, allfour selected inputs decided, droppedfourth rejection and retained credit membership;1/1 passes in7,069.43 s (`target/qualification/kagemusha-receive/pinned-omega-accept/run.log`). The later native-predicate capture passes its genuine malformed-sigma Receive chain in1,395.16 s: all10A/9W, all19 strict original imports and checkpoints, native four-predicate proposals, A1 fixed/permutation/advice parity, and W/signature-owner mutation checks. Proof sources and copied executable remain unchanged (`target/qualification/native-worker-predicate-terminal/receive-predicates.log`, binary `993ec675…0866d`). This is captured burn-branch component evidence; it does not install the full52-source wallet grant. | The corrected Bootstrap-only malformed-sigma chain qualifies its captured carried-scope keys. Accepted/renewed/corrected-value captures still predate the policy correction and require fresh A/W/catalog qualification. The accepted outer capture uses the prior history-hash continuation source and superseded Load ancestry. Current accepted/renewed/corrected proof and outer closure, ordinary-finality Load, the full catalog and durable wallet integration remain open. Component timings are not performance gates. |
| Administrative leaves | Fixed k12 Unload, Retiring and Archive leaves produce genuine3,296B proofs with opening decisions; consuming leaf/schema/mutation checks preserve unrelated state, exact balance/nullifier/ordinal/charge bounds and irreversible retirement. Archive own authorization, original evidence addresses, signature Q ownership, result bits and opening commitments pass focused component checks. Its retained proof owner rejects coherently re-signed oversized Payments and covers raw retained Omega/sigma capacities8,597/8,277 under the shared joint bound; incoming Receive/Status carriers cover9,321/8,132 bytes. Missing/duplicate tasks and misplaced Q owners reject. The fixed native producer has10A/9W owners, exact source-key imports, borrowed PK use and canonical checkpoints. Core and adjusted pending owners each fit16,983 rows and pass mutation/layout tests; both adjusted removal and terminal closure enforce Corrected no-op. Earlier seven/nine/eleven/ten-stage source failures are retained in their qualification directories and do not qualify current sources. The fixed-stage-context constructor-predecessor capture passes both actual-Q19-key original import sweeps (Status559.49s, Receive616.15s), including truncation/wrong-stage rejection, plus77 native tests (`archive-constant-context-imports`). Genuine current Bootstrap Omega metadata then exposed Status retained-proof stage1 at66,341>65,529 rows; an extra range bus did not help and was removed. Exact two128-bit message halves preserve all256 bits and existing raw-tape/claim/owner bindings; strict all-byte/half/malformed/layout mutation regression passes72.24s, with independent review. Both actual-Q/k12-incoming source sweeps now fit every10A/9W source using that proved predecessor descriptor/VK: Status maximum64,195 rows (71.16s), Receive63,048 (66.62s), under unchanged65,529 (`archive-two-half-context`, binary0f49a8e6…ba85). Fresh exact-key imports pass all19A/W original keys for each variant (Status403.25s, Receive294.50s), with wrong-stage/truncation rejection; the complete Omega catalog is a separate gate. A further actual-k14 incoming sigma/Q source sweep fits all ten stages (maximum63,344 rows,55.16s; `archive-k14-source`). Its strict original-import sweep passes all19A/W keys, including truncation/wrong-stage rejection (447.25s; `archive-k14-import`, binaryd7819bd4…3c2f); the immutable executable and predecessor originals stayed unchanged, with unrelated finality/Receive source drift recorded. Complete Archive proofs and catalog admission remain pending. Current Bootstrap-to-Retiring passes1/1 in1,315.82s using the new fixed-stage context: all4A/3W genuine proofs, seven strict original imports, metadata-only/borrowed-key exact proof-byte parity, fresh canonical checkpoint replay and all opening decisions; no Load ancestry. Its A maxima34,484/38,591/61,340/56,575 and7,744B proofs are captured in `kagemusha-receive/o1-current/retiring-*` (binary66652c55…d5a0). Earlier consuming and Archive component captures remain scoped to their superseded sources. | Final Retiring Omega, complete full-domain Archive accept/no-op chains, native proof-byte parity and final shared catalog/provider admission remain unqualified. Funded Unload and Archive composition require the genuine ordinary-finality Load fixture, which is not installed. Source layouts and busy-host suite durations do not establish memory/latency or phone gates. |
| Refresh shared leaf / recursive owners | One fixed k12 tag7 sigma key proves all five update kinds with genuine 3,296 B proofs and a 2,538-row maximum. All five proofs verify under that key, and genuine Q-sigma composition passes all five kinds under one shared Q key (7,008 B local proofs), with every opening decided. Leaf/schema tests cover exact kind selection, unchanged fields, counters/floor, intersections, expiry, five original signed tapes, hard3V/2F slots, direct certificates and mandatory map owners. Actual compact Bootstrap-rooted Credential, SchemePolicy and TimeAnchor Q/A/W compositions pass together (1,935.63 s); Blacklist's four A/three W closure also passes inside the retained map-capacity attempt. Every A proof is7,744 B; maximum source rows are61,725/61,671/61,659/61,665 respectively. Original sigma/Q0/Q1/Q2 proofs, native opening decisions, retained context history and adversarial omission/changed-original tests are exercised. Source/binary manifests and logs are retained under `target/qualification/refresh-recursive*` and `refresh-map-recursive*`; these capture the compiled candidate rather than later source edits. Quota's complete stage failed the fixed k16 gate at91,131 rows, before oversized proof generation. The replacement keeps all 64 slots and all 578 semantics, using mandatory old/window/usage root tasks plus exact matching and a shared typed subhash/issue/count context. Isolated typed owners pass (maximum 28,638 rows), but the first eight-stage composition failed at PreviousRoot with 68,931 rows after four valid 7,744 B A proofs; its source/binary/log remain in `target/qualification/quota-split-recursive*`. The revised root-only path retains object proposals while mandatory original and merge owners recompute every signed tape and issue/count. Two proposal binding/schema/layout tests pass (69.26 s); independent code review found no binding gap, conditional on complete source-bound closure (`target/qualification/quota-root-proposals*`). The following eight-stage preflight stopped before Refresh proofs: PreviousRoot fit at 65,490 rows, but later WindowRoot/UsageRoot reached 67,303/70,411 (`target/qualification/quota-root-proposal-preflight*`). The current seven-stage schedule moves roots before longer continuation histories without dropping any owner. All seven unknown-witness layouts and actual proofs pass, with maxima53,206/60,014/63,122/62,715/61,679/62,974/61,420 under the unchanged65,529 ceiling (`target/qualification/quota-seven-native*`). The representative-W preflights remain sizing diagnostics, not later-stage key-identity evidence. Their replacement sequentially derives every A/W verifier and requires exact binding/VK equality before actual proofs. All seven captured sequential unknown-source preflights reproduce those fitting bounds; the same captured candidate also passes actual proof and borrowed-key replay below. Unknown-source planning alone is not proof evidence. The captured actual chain independently derives each successive key and reproduces the fitting bounds. That captured candidate reaches complete seven-A/six-W closure: every A proof is7,744 B, all five signed originals and hard3V/2F remain bound, and every opening decides. The complete captured test passes1/1 in3,884.48 s, including exact native A/W proof-byte parity, every checkpoint restoration and canonical Norito payload replay. It uses the earlier typed-key mount and does not qualify the subsequent strict original-PK importer or a latency gate. Installed native Credential Refresh passes exact original-key/proof parity for all four A and three W stages, full checkpoint restoration and changed-proof/Q/stage rejection (1,111.59 s, `target/qualification/native-refresh-credential*`); the retained-candidate SchemePolicy/TimeAnchor/Blacklist run also passes all three kinds (3,983.89 s, `target/qualification/native-refresh-policy-anchor-blacklist*`), reproducing every original A/W proof byte and raw checkpoint. Captured preparation and canonical checkpoint codec tests pass10/10, and the earlier native component batch passes61/61 (`target/qualification/native-refresh-original-unit*`). The current metadata-only Bootstrap/Send/Refresh native batch passes70 tests, with one explicit ordinary-Load capacity test ignored, including both-curve foreign-key rejection, bounds, checkpoints and source-profile guards; the exact same binary passes all five Archive constructor cases (`target/qualification/native-metadata-checks/`). The subsequent fresh Archive source-profile assertion also passes1/1, requiring its exact Tagged3 layout to equal the shared terminal descriptor. These unit tests do not qualify current-source genuine proof replay; the captured Quota native run separately passes canonical payload restoration. The captured strict original-PK Credential run passes1/1 in2,985.22 s (`target/qualification/native-refresh-original-credential2*`): all4A/3W exact source imports, changed stage/VK/table/truncation rejection, exact proof-byte replay and canonical checkpoints pass. That source retained all PKs. The current producer replaces eager retention with shared descriptor/VK metadata and one per-stage original import returning a borrowed PK; no original bytes or proving buffers remain in the producer. Exact full descriptor/VK checks precede folds, and source imports reconstruct the installed stage without accepted claims or key generation. Metadata creation is not catalog authority. Independent review found no local binding gap; shared-metadata/Receive units pass15/15. Current borrowed Refresh integration checks pass. Captured Credential Refresh now passes1/1 in3,725.63 s (`native-refresh-borrowed-credential*`): all4A/3W strict original source imports, foreign borrowed-key rejection, exact original proof bytes, and raw/canonical checkpoint replay. Captured Quota now passes1/1 in4,990.54 s (`target/qualification/native-refresh-borrowed-quota*`): all7A/6W actual proofs use exact sequential verifier identities, strict original-PK source imports and borrowed stage keys; every original proof byte matches and all raw/canonical checkpoints restore. Every opening decides. Its captured binary SHA is `2e1cb9d349cabca85aef4782b5c9a85e3788816632d16b2966edab4c0528881a`; source drift during compilation is retained in its manifest, so this qualifies that executable component rather than later concurrent edits. No RSS or phone-memory gate follows from the ownership change. CoreZK now converts exact retained Credential/SchemePolicy/Blacklist/TimeAnchor originals into native Refresh inputs. Renewal keeps predecessor Credential/Enrollment custody for C4 and authenticates the released capsule under its successor Credential. Native policy evaluation derives the exact effect and complete successor; unrelated state changes, forged/replayed updates and changed history paths reject. All22 preparation component tests pass, including5new signed Refresh cases (`target/qualification/corezk-refresh-preparation/results.json`). The new Quota conversion retains a canonical 64-slot predecessor-usage frame under explicit capsule role 10 (exactly one iff QuotaShare), authenticates its root against the actual predecessor, and derives every successor slot from the exact signed share. Independent source review found no local binding gap. The actual Rust generator and three canonical witness/role cases pass; complete Kotlin/Swift vector classes pass 39/36 cases with unchanged generated fixture inputs. Full/empty usage frames are 2,805/181 bytes under the 8,192-byte cap; the quota capsule is 7,591 bytes. The corrected initial Rust fixture-field and Swift frame-count failures are retained. The fresh complete data-model namespace passes 228 cases with two explicit maintenance captures ignored (34.60 s), including the regenerated fixture and Archive retained-role requirements. The expanded CoreZK preparation namespace passes 33 cases, including Quota, complete Load/Archive conversion and unfolded sigma preparation; all 12 capsule tests pass, including power-loss replica repair and exact quota-witness replay. CoreZK source remained unchanged throughout build and execution; the exact pre-acyclic-scheme proof dependency is retained separately. These are captured component results (`target/qualification/quota-refresh-custody/results.json`), with later proof-policy and transitive M3 source changes excluded. These tests do not establish genuine released-receipt or installed-producer acceptance. | Final Ω wrappers under the full shared terminal catalog and the installed wallet producer remain open. No release terminal admission, performance gate or physical-phone compliance follows from these component runs. |
| Pre-Advance administrative preparation | All five Refresh kinds derive exact sigma witnesses from verified released heads, including unfolded heads, retaining signed original frames, map openings and source capsule identity. Six typed administrative proving adapters bind the complete26-field statement and exact installed D/VK before proving and full verification. Load preparation now binds an opaque qualified receipt source to the exact installation, verifies receipt finality and both claims, authenticates the recovery insertion, and derives checked net balance/ordinal/sequence while retaining original receipt/finality bytes. Two independent source reviews found no local binding gap. Native consuming preparation now derives Unload/Retiring from the opaque verified fold, authenticates exact charge originals and both insertion paths, preserves adjusted lineage values and all unrelated fields, and removes the public caller-derived consuming witness API. The captured preparation namespace passes 49 ordinary cases (1.11 s), including seven consuming signature/strict-sigma/adversarial tests; the explicit public Refresh case passes 1/1 (11.13 s) with actual 3,296 B sigma proofs for all five updates and re-signed corrupt predecessor rejection. `target/qualification/prepare-consuming/current/results.json` retains executable `a41f8067517254c065cb97c1f911284e6fd0890c29a71d355b87d1e189af73bc`, unchanged preparation sources and separate lifecycle status failures. Earlier Load captures remain scoped to their records. | Genuine public Load preparation still requires the complete ordinary receipt proof and qualified installation; the full public consuming path requires the actual verified fold and installed producer. Arithmetic fixtures do not confer either capability. The Refresh test uses two actual sigma keys in a signed engineering inventory and a synthetic retained marker; it does not qualify recursive admission, complete producer authority or actual Advance custody. Native must recheck source identity under its commit lock. No wallet-open, performance or phone qualification follows. |
| Indexed maps / state openings | Eight IMT tests pass, covering both fields, full-depth G1 vectors, authenticated empty insertion, removed-slot clearing, full integer key order, immutable first records and every-cell small-circuit tampering. The 25-case state/statement and operation-map suite passes (including Bootstrap, Load, Unload, Retiring and all five refresh state effects) for core33/rest8/statement26, all operation tags, recomputed-hash forgeries, exact control masks, identity/head continuity, OQ-3 and Archive no-op. Production-depth map components fit k16 (Send 31,746, Receive 35,446 Archive 31,524 and Unload recovery 17,094 maximum assigned rows). The obsolete indexed quota upsert/update/dummy-witness API is removed; native tree tests pass with duplicate/zero rejection and final-slot exhaustion. Three focused indexed tests additionally pass after native removal was added: both fields authenticate the predecessor relink and cleared leaf, absent/sentinel removal leaves state unchanged, and cleared slots are never reused, including after u32::MAX allocation. Shared digest parity passes 17 tests (one long case ignored). Blacklist refresh insertion and Request-recorded history lookup pass, including hard route authentication with a soft pair verdict. The fixed64 quota rebuild passes at 51,652 sponge / 36,008 range / 17,670 glue rows, including full64 matching, first-share, expired/unused drops, exact signed window count in 1..=64, and recomputed-root reset/end/drop attacks; the same component passes on the recursive duplex. Independent source review found no local merge/state-effect gap. Shared hash framing passes both-field tests and all eight IMT tests after generic lane composition. | These constraints are components to be bound to authenticated operation inputs and recursive verdicts. They do not authorize a payment by themselves. |
| Node enrollment journal | The private prepared-worker protocol binds the journal incarnation, exact preparation and durable acknowledgement before E1. Complete/Recover claim once; Inspect reads only an exact retained result, including after expiry. Fresh eligibility is required before live recovery, signing and E6 delivery. The captured private Python package passes **212/212** with unchanged source/runtime pins (`target/qualification/enrollment-inspect/full-suite-5-installer`); the separate initializer and installed wheel entry point also pass, preserving occupied/partial-store refusal. The earlier Rust protocol suite passes17 cases with two maintenance generators ignored. Generic Bank/SchemeOperator policy and 24 actual Rust vectors pass11 Model, eight middleware, eight Kotlin and one Java component cases. The captured Rust HTTP/middleware/pool suite passes **29/29** (`sdk-enrollment-http-current`); its independent45-depfile/five-build-output audit retains the original broad prose-drift refusal. The copied Core executable passes13 issuer and38 journal cases. The corrected supervised Torii copy passes **28/28**: five signer, nine actual local HTTPS, two account-authentication, five supervised lifetime and seven worker/process cases (`target/qualification/enrollment-service-torii-supervised-2`). Its exact executable and owned runtime inputs remain unchanged; independent audit of86 actual local compiler artifacts and nine build outputs establishes that its two recorded broad-drift paths were not consumed. Earlier fixture/build failures remain retained. | Every universal-dataspace token is eligible without Parliament, a named-token allowlist or legal-class gate. The new asset-independent templates, exact asset-bearing middleware observation and native finality-backed Global registration path are implemented; fixed-asset CBSI/BPNG profiles remain deployment adapters. Model/SDK strict lint passes. Actual Rust regeneration supplies24 new template/observation vectors; all24 old and24 new vectors match Kotlin/JVM (nine Kotlin and one Java case). The copied Model passes15 eligibility and nine enrollment-policy cases; two maintenance generators are explicitly ignored. Its four registration cases initially fail on compressed public-key fixtures; all four pass after correction in the refreshed Model copy (`universal-asset-model-sdk-2`), with genuine native certificates and explicitly synthetic execution rows. The generated observation is344B within2048B. The same copied Rust SDK passes **32/32**, including11 middleware cases, with zero runtime source drift. Independent48-depfile/five-script audit excludes22 unrelated build-drift paths without changing the original broad classification (`target/qualification/universal-asset-model-sdk`). Actual WSV registration passes for three arbitrary asset identities and scales0/2/28 without Parliament. Both current Core tests now pass, including genuine StateExecutor success/rejection and exact finalized Register extraction; all eight CLI publication cases also pass (`enrollment-universal-corrected/registration-cli-runtime`). The latter preserves exact package reopening, changed-input refusal and foreign-instance rejection at the first non-genesis certificate. Runtime sources and copied binaries remain unchanged; actual external consumed changes during compilation retain the original `component_only_source_inconclusive` classification. Earlier compressed-key and wrong-chain fixture failures remain separately retained. The copied native bridge passes **66/66** installed-selection/custody/layout cases, including four generic release/session tests, with unchanged runtime sources (`universal-asset-bridge-runtime/installed-runtime`). The copied universal-template Torii namespace passes **31/31** with unchanged executable; its broad source/runtime drift from coordinated subsequent repairs is retained (`enrollment-universal-torii-cli-current/issuer-runtime`). The corrected same-build copies additionally pass14 issuer,38 journal,18 worker protocol,11 native registration and8 shared production ledger cases, with two explicit worker-maintenance ignores (`enrollment-universal-corrected`). Exact binaries and Python interpreter/tool pins remain unchanged; broader runtime source drift is retained where observed. The shared ledger tests exercise the actual paired publication/restart transition with an explicitly substituted recursive test workload; they are not real monetary proof evidence. Standalone CoreZk and bridge lib/tests strict lint pass; broader Core/CLI strict lint fails in unrelated existing code and the workspace formatting check retains14 findings before owned formatting repairs. The guarded ABI27 host has341 exports including all84 required symbols; current captured Swift246, Kotlin/JNI60 and C#536 cases pass against its exact dylib SHA `ae5589d06b41027f1ccbd4924255c92164e3e2ee49b5a15a62b7852e58606090`. Swift's unrelated source drift and the initial JNI runner's wrong-ABI artifact refusal remain retained. Full release packaging and actual service deployment remain pending. With regenerated Rust worker originals, the full Python suite passes **214/214** in37.691s with unchanged interpreter and source pins (`enrollment-inspect/full-suite-6-universal-template`). Its two added cases exercise synthetic AppAttest A→B→A under one retained store generation and reject the retired preparation schema. This is component evidence using synthetic platform evidence and test keys. A later disposable ARM Linux guest runs the unchanged214-case suite:206 pass, eight Darwin-only cases skip. Six additional non-root archive-entrypoint cases exercise actual CLOCK_BOOTTIME expiry, fixed FD18/19 with empty environment, fragmented framing, prepared Inspect, synthetic Apple signature completion, EOF/join/restart, exact expired replay and writable-config refusal. The receipt at `target/qualification/enrollment-linux-guest/receipt.json` pins47 sources,659 guest runtime/tool hashes, the checksum-verified official image and clean guest shutdown; two fixture-harness failures remain retained. The guest uses a RAM filesystem, so this establishes neither disk power-loss durability nor the compiled Rust Torii launcher. Complete serving deployment, monetary exchange and phone qualification remain open. Exact asset authorization, reserve consent/backing and applicable controls remain required. Bank-required policies keep KYC/freeze checks and never fall back after bank failure. The journal retains complete exchanges and one-time consumption under its existing3MiB record cap. OS/interpreter dependency trust and privileged whole-filesystem rollback remain outside the local journal guarantee. |
| Wallet / integration | Source-stable Core executable `5e1c41f9…50c355` passes **147 state/recovery**, **214 Advance/provider**, **18 enrollment-owner** and **1 elapsed-boundary** cases, zero ignored (`target/qualification/core-complete-source-metadata-2`); all20,878 source/package/vendor/tool inputs and runtime source remained unchanged. Native permits bind retained client/attempt/slot and same-boot generation elapsed; exact E6 issuer selection, durable Abandon replay/loss refusal and tri-state original reads are exercised. Maximal E6 is **260,907 bytes**, below262,144. The later source-stable Core copy `18f21a5f…5e8c8b` passes **233 Advance cases**; its state run passes147 and fails three new CloseLoads fixtures because they omitted authoritative source custody. Those fixtures now retain the exact verified source snapshot; all three pass from later diagnostic executable `c6cc502b…eb3da6`, alongside six native-ledger continuity/publication/payout cases. Shared coordination retains source-selected originals/maps, Request-recorded blacklist gaps, replay indexes and durable folds. Native Credited conversion and the background worker preserve exact outputs, cooperative payment cancellation, parked errors and join-before-release; **38 C boundary cases pass**. The guarded CloseLoads ABI26 host `3b51ff55…5b0ee5` passes **4 actual JNI** and **86 managed Kotlin** cases. Its admitted original Swift package passes **133 cases** (114 wallet/load/platform/vectors and19 confidential), with unchanged SDK sources and producer pins; six additional confidential keyset cases and one current-source retirement guard pass from the same retained executable. Original logs and receipts are under `target/qualification/native-enrollment/{close-loads-swift,kotlin-closeloads-current-results}` and `native-sdk/{host-abi26-close-loads-current,swift-abi26-close-loads-current}`. | Captured local component evidence only; explicit simulated provider boundaries do not establish physical custody or genuine52-route operation. Subsequent source adds retained FeeClaim retrieval and canonical online claim construction, bounded sequential native finality rooted in installed genesis, durable checkpoint selection and authenticated payout acknowledgement. Current merged managed Kotlin **147 cases pass**; current Swift source parses. Current native C/registry/installation/setup executable `b713cf2f…ac429f` passes **85 cases**, zero ignored, with private checkout-local build/runtime scratch (`target/qualification/native-enrollment/fee-ledger-c-current`). Strict CoreZk and bridge lib/tests Clippy passes, including normal-mode compilation of all five shipping oracle-build guards. Retained diagnostic executable `59c9f12b…e92ccd` passes **six fee, six ledger and three CloseLoads cases**; the earlier two stale Request fixture failures remain retained. Actual encoding measures a20,060-byte pair carrier and a16,348-byte online claim containing a10,000-byte Payment plus a6,381-byte canonical multisig beneficiary; the next larger claim is rejected by the16KiB aggregate cap. Build-source drift and unpinned system temporary build scratch prevent a candidate-qualified label for that executable. CloseLoads preserves request-id replay while allowing a later authenticated source to close newly issued loads. The installed loader now allows a512MiB cumulative engineering finality D/V extent, covering the observed406,815,883 bytes while preserving per-original bounds and the64MiB process MSM cap; phone memory is unqualified. These newer components require a coherent source capture and rebuilt SDK runtime; the canonical FeeClaim retains its existing16KiB aggregate cap without a separate4KiB beneficiary exclusion. The later captured ABI26 host `46f10abf…212222` passes five C and six JNI probes plus158 managed Kotlin cases. Its source-admitted Swift package passes211 selected cases with zero skipped in654.971s, including five actual native confidential tests, four PeerWallet request cases and five application-auth cases (`target/qualification/native-enrollment/eligibility-merged-swift-tests-current`). The receipt pins34 XCTest bundle files and records six SDK source changes from the subsequent merge. This is captured pre-merge component evidence; it does not qualify the newly resolved selectors or current complete candidate. The merged installed-runtime/review surface requires another reconciliation after that merge. The native Unload DATA projection now selects the exact retained request/plan/receipt and credential originals, survives historical capsule collection and restart without signing, and requires the admitted account plus exact quoted beneficiary. Diagnostic Core `30256198…f0b3e8` passes all three projection/recovery cases; latest managed Kotlin144 cases pass and Swift parses (`target/qualification/unload-projection`). The rebuilt, source-admitted host `5b73dc39…3eef46` passes five actual C and six actual JNI probes, alongside 144 managed Kotlin cases. The initial JNI Review-fixture failure is retained; the corrected request includes its required destination original and tests the empty-destination refusal. The Swift response parser and public result type enforce the same closed status range. Its source-admitted test invocation retained a compile failure in the incoming Request transport range expression; that syntax is repaired and parses, while full Swift runtime awaits the next matching native package. The ignored native acceptance harness requires a separately pinned actually executed ledger setup: distinct registered A/B/C accounts41/42/43, actual asset incarnation, matching canonical genesis, and ordered H1/H2 finality originals. Its ordinary account-binding test passes from the same copied binary; the independent native host-enrollment/restart case also passed from `5c0fe857…90e51c4`. The exporter then proves A's Bootstrap/Activate and retains its exact IssueLoad target; the consumer reopens the same custody/payment key and requires an independently pinned matching finalized receipt. Its consumer covers actual A → B → C proofs, pending Send recovery, exact replay, duplicate refusal, fold/restart, conservation and verified Unload-claim export. The earlier strict CoreZk lib/tests Clippy passed; the latest combined bridge lint is retained as a failure on five unrelated CBSI selection findings. Both artifact-dependent tests remain unexecuted. The actual executed setup is now exported and independently reviewed: canonical genesis registers distinct A/B/C/reserve accounts and the actual asset, mints 1,000 atomic units only to A, then certifies H2 through the actual StateExecutor. Core setup tests pass three cases (two artifact-dependent cases ignored), and its explicit exporter passes separately. The exact ordered H1/H2 originals, setup pin `407c7593…fa880`, runtime receipt and preserved broad-source inconclusive record are retained in `target/qualification/executed-ledger-setup-build-2`; a supplemental review verifies all76 actual depfiles and nine build outputs, without qualifying the whole checkout. Independent proof-source intake passes all seven semantic mutations, and the interrupted canonical finality-source construction has no terminal receipt. The corresponding complete signed source graph and matching A receipt remain required; the older genesis/asset/receipt fixture cannot substitute for them. No substitute grant or proof is accepted. This harness does not execute node settlement; genuine catalog/provisioning, real-proof exchange/unload, four-validator and physical-phone gates remain open. Enrollment, Abandon and load closure return originals, never ledger acknowledgement. Earlier Swift guard refusals and ABI25/pre-permit captures remain historical diagnostics. |
| Ledger services | The dedicated Load publisher and its configuration are deleted. The captured generator-produced KAGEMUSHA data-model executable passes 224 cases (99.18 s), including ordinary transaction and certified Load-event verification, the exact native capture fixture, and the measured 679-byte Credited::Receive framing plus 9,321-byte proof budget. Both Receive selectors preserve exact frozen lengths; inclusive-envelope and cap+1 checks pass. Two maintenance captures remain explicitly ignored. The actual Rust generator emitted only the two new bounds keys and their explanatory metadata; the fresh-source follow-up encountered the active ordinary-Load type migration and is retained as failed, without transferring captured results to that newer source. Configuration passes all 1,035 cases (732 library and 303 integration), including rejection of the retired publisher role. The actual Rust inventory generator passes and regenerates the canonical JSON with 972 classified domains and 47 construction users, including the ordinary-Load event-path lookup key and its seven counted-Merkle uses. The expanded Core selection passes 109 cases with zero failures and two explicit ignores (231.98 s). It covers both new event-path tests, all five native finality-cursor tests, historical receipt recovery after chain growth and local QC loss, private-root refusal before debit/receipt creation, exact Load/retry/rollback, journal custody, payload refunds, all seven exact native/STARK admission cases and native P2P ingress. Source and executable provenance are retained in `target/qualification/kagemusha-integration-current`; concurrent proof/dependency changes make these captured results, not a frozen current-candidate qualification. Two actual Kagami exports are byte-identical and match both canonical schemas, including the certified Load event and removal of retired publisher types. | Component evidence only. Test-only epoch guards retain original fixture generations while exact payload-refund assertions run. The current captured Sumeragi protocol/simulator executable passes 441 cases with zero failures and two explicit heavy cases ignored, using five fixed seeds per randomized scenario (2,026.18 s; `target/qualification/consensus-after-enrollment/run-1`). Its sampled sources and copied executable remain unchanged; this component run does not establish a complete candidate dependency closure. The earlier actual strict 133-mutation execution completes with its full baseline passed, all 133 mutants killed by named tests, and zero survivors, errors or scenario-only kills, using the complete non-fast 200-seed mode (24,572.36 s). Fifty scenario subsets do not independently kill their mutants; their required named tests do. The gate itself exits zero, but its source-bound wrapper refuses current-candidate qualification because `Cargo.lock` is the sole changed path among 1,524 captured inputs. The complete report and this boundary are retained in `target/qualification/kagemusha-sumeragi-current/captured-gate-result.json`. A separate exact-hash lock recovery and dependency-impact review finds only the incoming `iroha_core_zk` → `iroha_sumeragi` edge: CoreZK is absent from all 254 resolved Sumeragi dependency packages and the declared source closure, every reachable package lock record is equal, and all 1,523 non-lock captured inputs matched at that review. This substantiates unchanged Sumeragi inputs without altering the original whole-file provenance rejection; it does not qualify the whole checkout or monetary network (`lock-impact-review.json`). The fresh full strict 200-seed mutation execution also passes: baseline plus **133 named-test kills**, zero survivors, errors or scenario-only kills, in11,027.18s (`target/qualification/consensus-after-enrollment/mutations-1`, report SHA `6c4ed3bdfa68de87472686a2a1d78caae3620285222f1d7f7a49a2dca4064eb1`). Its50 scenario misses are still killed by the required named tests. Independent review verifies948 retained logs, all201 actual local compiler inputs from282 depfiles,36 build outputs and254 reachable packages. The changed lock edge and dev/test profile are outside this release dependency closure; the runner change only adds unselected Core mutations, with its selected Sumeragi table and algorithms unchanged. The original399-path/HEAD drift refusal remains. The supplement (`mutations-1/independent-review/receipt.json`) accepts component execution only: registry archives were reconstructed after execution, per-mutant binaries were overwritten by the two build lanes, and the SDK/stdlib/OS closure was not fully pinned. These limits prevent a whole-checkout or release qualification claim. Preparation passes 10/10 and the expanded wallet state/recovery suite passes 42/42 (57.36 s), including the required complete ordered checkpoint-chain restart case. Both retain dependency source-drift records and are captured component evidence. The refreshed stock default-feature daemon/client and separate source-stable harness pass all three required real four-validator cases: commit36.22s, individual plus whole-cluster restart106.95s, and stopped-leader replacement36.29s (`target/qualification/sumeragi-network-current-run-1/summary.json`). Every case uses exactly four peers, unchanged copied binaries and no ignored tests; no peers remain after teardown. Independent stock-build review of100 local compiler artifacts and11 build outputs identifies its two broad-drift paths as unconsumed; the original source-scope classification is retained. Source edits resumed after the immutable copies and are recorded during the last two runtime cases. These are exact-binary consensus component results, not current post-capture checkout or KAGEMUSHA monetary-network qualification. The genuine complete signed native-inventory WSV case remains explicitly ignored in the debug selection; the separately executed inventory generator passed. Committed receipts are recovery data: monetary Load requires independently verified normal block finality and exact receipt binding. Complete genuine ordinary-finality Load proof qualification, real-proof wallet exchange/unload on at least four validators, and current release artifacts remain required. |

The earlier repaired-harness **diagnostic**, binary SHA-256
`58b0368064ce8ab590d4e0a6bafce17e73d3aea9115b23ec41826db92903217b`, produced
two valid PIPA-R proofs in each configuration below on the shared Mac. It
includes shared A round selectors, reused quotient coset buffers and exact
DAG normalization. The worktree was not frozen for these runs; there was no
calibration/repetition qualification. Raw records are retained in
`target/qualification/m3-pilot-20261006-normalized-dag/`; earlier raw attempts
remain under the adjacent `m3-pilot-*` directories. RSS is the kernel lifetime
peak, including key generation, and is not phase-subtracted. Time is the slower
of the two proofs. Q is the 5-variable-key/1-fixed-key signature chip workload;
A is the IMT-like load, not a complete operation relation.

| Real workload | Workers | Judged diagnostic time | Peak RSS bytes | Gate observation |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Q chips | 1 | 29.9847 s CPU | 750,321,664 | Inside hard limits; lacks 10% time margin |
| Q chips | 4 | 10.1756 s elapsed | 674,955,264 | Exceeds 10 s; RSS below 0.75 GiB |
| A IMT load | 1 | 33.0941 s CPU | 764,788,736 | Inside hard limits; lacks 10% time margin |
| A IMT load | 4 | 10.0960 s elapsed (diagnostic) | 728,449,024 | RSS below 0.85 GiB; no A4 time gate is invented |

Q proofs are 7,936 bytes; the shared-selector A workload proofs are 7,584 bytes.
Those are local chip workload proofs, not transported Omega artifacts.

No synthetic-shape or phone result is inferred from these chip diagnostics.
Streaming/allocation changes or narrower/split workloads must meet the existing
limits before M3 is marked qualified.

### Earlier observations (retired layouts; not current qualification)

Records below follow §2. Source: `optimizations` at `df9c70cdb3` plus the
uncommitted working tree of 2026-10-03; host: Apple-silicon Mac, 20 CPUs, 128 GiB,
shared with other build jobs (timings ±25%). No phone, live network or payment was used.

| Check | Record | Result and limits |
|---|---|---|
| G1 canonical objects and transcripts | observed as expected | `iroha_data_model::kagemusha::kagemusha_wallet_v1` ([wire record](kagemusha_wallet_wire_v1.md)): 129 unit tests pass (`scripts/cargo_fast.sh --stable-local-metadata --incremental --target-slot kagemusha-wallet -- test -p iroha_data_model --lib kagemusha_wallet_v1`), including every-byte-flip, decode-order, bound (limit, limit+1) and Norito-tag tests. Not yet consumed by the proof relation, provider, bridge, node or Torii. |
| Low-S signature rule (§8) | observed as expected | Native codec accepts `s = floor(n/2)` and rejects `floor(n/2)+1`, `n - s`, `r = 0`, `s = 0`, `r = n`, `s = n`; signer DER and raw high-S output is normalized and verified before freezing. In-circuit enforcement used the old halo2 P-256 gadget `assert_p256_ecdsa_digest::<F, 256, true>`, deleted with the old recursion code; the PIPA-v1 relation must re-implement it, and no relation consumes the new objects yet. |
| Cross-language vectors | observed as expected | `fixtures/kagemusha/wallet_v1_vectors.json` (generated by the Rust test; `IROHA_UPDATE_KAGEMUSHA_WALLET_VECTORS=1` regenerates), SHA `94a70b5d0bd442737838e18fa95232deef81e270aebdc09f42d106510a314711`. Current Kotlin `KagemushaWalletVectorsV1Test`39/39 and Swift `KagemushaWalletVectorsV1Tests`36/36 pass; Swift ran in the ordinary package with the source-admitted ABI25 local-unit archive. The prior ABI21 package refusal and source-only failures are retained, not reclassified as passes. Captured provenance is in `target/qualification/kagemusha-sdk-current`. JS, Python and C# KAGEMUSHA consumers: not run (not written). |
| Payment, Credited and Offer size bounds | observed as expected (stand-in proofs) | Size tests assert the worst cases with stand-in proofs of the provisional caps (transition 6,016 B, CreditStatus 2,000 B). Stand-in proofs are structural only and are not completed payments. |
| In-circuit P-256 cost | measured | One full-width low-S verification: 1,466,624 advice cells = 23 advice + 4 lookup columns at k=16 in each Pasta field. A k=16 proof of that circuit alone: 10,112 B per parity; prove 12.5–13.0 s (20 threads), 20.7–24.2 s (4), 31.9–32.8 s (1); verify 0.26 s; peak RSS 0.79–0.95 GiB. |
| IPA proof scaling | measured | Test-only harness `crates/iroha_core_zk/src/g3_proof_scaling_measurement_tests.rs` (ignored tests, release; deleted with the old recursion code and recoverable from Git history). k=16 proof bytes = 1,976 + 358·(advice columns); prove ≈ 7.2 s + 0.54 s per column at 20 threads; peak RSS ≈ 257 MiB + 27 MiB per column; proving key ≈ 25.5 MB + 9.1 MB per column. Narrow no-lookup proofs: bytes = 768 + 352·W + 64·k (k=18–20, W=1–3: 2,272–3,104 B), prove 21–80 s, verify 1.0–3.2 s. One thread is only 2.5–3.3× slower than 20. |
| Recursive-verifier building blocks | measured | ≈ 2,170 advice cells per MSM source (`reciprocal_compact_batch_allocation_diagnostic_in_both_parities`, a deleted old-recursion diagnostic: 1,008 sources = 34 advice + 6 lookup columns at k=16); dense rows for 1,008 sources: 131,046 rows in 9.3 s. |
| R9 and 2 s p95 with the current construction | deviation (estimate from the measured models) | A Send transition needs ≥ 6 in-circuit P-256 verifications plus transcripts, maps and recursion (≈ 150–230 columns): ≈ 55–85 KB per parity at k=16, so Payment ≤ 10,000 B needs a narrow large-k outer layer, whose proving alone is ≈ 21–80 s per parity on this host. End-to-end 2 s p95 is not reachable on this path; proposal revision 2026-10-04 moves recursion off the payment path (split lineage). |
| Android Keystore absence semantics | source reading | AOSP `AndroidKeyStoreSpi` (android14-release): `containsAlias` returns false on any Keystore error, `aliases`/`size`/`getCertificate*` swallow errors, only `getKey` distinguishes `KEY_NOT_FOUND`; keystore2 `rebind_alias` replaces an existing alias on generation. Device confirmation: not run. |
| Android lock-screen removal | source reading | keystore2 android12–14 `reset_user(.., keep_non_super_encrypted_keys=true)` deletes certificate-only and super-encrypted entries and keeps plain non-auth keys; Android 15 depends on build flag `fix_unlocked_device_required_keys_v2`. Device confirmation: not run. |
| Android backup/restore | source reading | `BackupAgent` never backs up `getNoBackupFilesDir()`, but a full-data restore of an app without its own agent first clears all app data and its Keystore namespace (`FullRestoreEngine` → `clearApplicationUserDataLIF`, android14). The wallet's backup set must therefore be empty. Device confirmation: not run. |
| iPhone keychain passcode class | source reading | Apple Platform Security: `kSecAttrAccessibleWhenPasscodeSetThisDeviceOnly` items are never backed up, synced or escrowed and become unusable when the passcode is removed or reset. Restart and power-loss durability after a write: not run. |

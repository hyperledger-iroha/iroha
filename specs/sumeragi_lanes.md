# Sumeragi multilane and autoscale lanes

Status: design, 2026-09-28; normative once implemented (goal S5 for lanes). Dataspaces with their
own state and cross-dataspace atomicity are specified in `sumeragi.md` §11 (goal S6).

## 0. Summary

A **lane** adds dissemination and certification capacity to the one global world state. Every lane
incarnation is a separate Sumeragi core instance with its own committee, pinned at creation. A
lane block is an ordered batch of transactions that the lane committee has checked for
*admission* (network, signature, deduplication) against a committed global block, its **anchor**;
a lane never mutates world state. The global chain `G` **merges** certified lane blocks by
reference: a `G` block names, per lane, the next contiguous certified lane heights, and executing
the `G` block executes those transactions against the world state in one canonical order. `G` is
the only place state changes, so transactions on different lanes need no cross-lane protocol:
their atomicity and ordering are those of the `G` block that merges them.

**Autoscale** is a deterministic rule in `G`'s execution. From committed load samples it opens a
new elastic lane (a fresh incarnation with a pinned committee, active two `G` heights later) or
closes the highest one. Closing is one committed height `c`; the **freshness bound** `A` makes
every lane block anchored before `c` unmergeable after `G` height `c + A`, so the lane's final
frontier is fixed at `c + A` with no drain vote, and the lane retires at `c + A + 1`.

Why this shape:

- The core is reused unchanged: a lane is just another instance (`I`, committee, parameters), so
  lane safety and liveness are the core's (`sumeragi.md` §7–§8).
- One world state, one execution order: no merge QC, merge leader, sidecar custody, relay
  settlement or drain certificate is needed, because `G`'s own CommitQC orders the merge.
- Every node follows every public lane (member or observer), so the bodies `G` executes are in
  every node's local lane stores through ordinary core sync.

## 1. Terms

- `G` — the global instance: the node's existing Sumeragi instance, height `h`.
- Lane `ℓ` — a `LaneId` of the committed lane catalog. Lane `0` (the anchor lane) is sequenced by
  `G` itself and has no instance. Every other active lane has one instance per incarnation.
- Incarnation `ι` — `H("iroha/sumeragi/lane/incarnation/v1" ‖ network_id ‖ be32(ℓ) ‖
  be64(dataspace) ‖ be64(creation_height) ‖ be64(creation_counter))`; the counter is the number
  of incarnations the chain has created, so `ι` is never reused.
- Lane instance id `I_ℓ,ι` — the core instance id (`sumeragi.md` §3.5) of kind `Lane` and index
  `ℓ` over the lane genesis hash (§2.3).
- Lane height `x` — height in the lane instance; lane genesis is `x = 0` (§2.3).
- Anchor `a(B)` — the `G` height named by lane block `B` (§3.2).
- Lane policy — the governed custom chain parameter `sumeragi_lane_policy`
  (`SumeragiLanePolicy`): freshness bound, merge bound, stall window, the chain parameters pinned
  into new lanes, the fixed lanes with their committees, explicit routes and the autoscale
  settings. Without it the chain has lane `0` only. `SetParameter` validates it (structure,
  pinned parameters, every fixed member's BLS-normal key and proof of possession).
- `A` — freshness bound: the policy's `anchor_freshness` (default 16), **pinned into each
  incarnation** at creation, so a policy change never alters an existing lane's rules.

## 2. Lane lifecycle in `G`'s state

### 2.1 Lifecycle record

World holds one `SumeragiLaneState` cell: the lane records (lanes ascending), the autoscale
samples (§6.1), the height of the last autoscale transition and the incarnation counter. A lane
record is

```text
SumeragiLaneRecord {
    lane: LaneId, dataspace: DataSpaceId, incarnation: [u8; 32],
    params: SumeragiParameters,           // the lane's chain parameters, pinned
    committee: Vec<{peer, pop}>,          // canonical order, pinned for the whole incarnation
    created_at: u64,                      // G height of the creating block
    active_from: u64,                     // created_at + 2
    closing: Option<u64>,                 // G close height c
    anchor_freshness: u64,                // A, pinned
    merged: {height, block_hash, result}, // highest merged lane block (lane genesis at first)
    merged_at: u64,                       // G height of the last frontier advance
    rescued: u64,                         // lane-routed transactions G executed directly since
}
```

The state is committed by the `G` block that writes it. A fixed lane is created when the policy
lists it (genesis, or the first block after a `SetParameter` that adds it); an elastic lane by
autoscale (§6). Lane `0` has no record.

### 2.2 States

`Created (G height < active_from) → Active → Closing (c set) → Retired (record removed)`.

- **Active** from `G` height `active_from`: nodes start the lane instance when they apply that
  height (§4.1); the lag of two gives every node the record before the first lane block can be
  merged.
- **Closing** from the `G` block that sets `c` (autoscale scale-in, stall close §6.4, a policy
  that no longer lists a fixed lane or lists it with another committee or dataspace, or a chain
  without a policy). A fixed lane the policy still lists is recreated, as a new incarnation, once
  its closing incarnation retires.
- **Retired** at `G` height `c + A + 1` (§6.3): the record is removed and the frontier is final.

### 2.3 The lane instance's configuration

The core needs `C_{x}`, `ChainParams_x` for every lane height and an `Init` (§12 of the core
spec). For a lane they are constants of the record:

- `C_{ℓ,x} = committee` for all `x` (BLS-normal keys with the pinned proofs of possession).
- `ChainParams_x = params` for all `x`; `R_x` still commits them (they never change).
- Lane genesis `x = 0`: `block_hash_0 = H("iroha/sumeragi/lane/genesis/v1" ‖ network_id ‖
  be32(ℓ) ‖ ι)`, `R_0 = H("iroha/sumeragi/lane/genesis-result/v1" ‖ norito(the fields fixed at
  creation))`. The record's `merged` frontier starts at this genesis.

A committee therefore cannot change within an incarnation; replacing members means closing the
lane and creating a new incarnation. A pinned member that loses its key stalls only this
lane, and §6.4 closes a stalled lane.

## 3. Lane blocks

### 3.1 Payload

A lane block's payload is the canonical Norito encoding of

```text
LaneBatch { anchor_height: u64, anchor_hash: Hash, transactions: Vec<SignedTransaction> }
```

It is never empty (work-driven, `sumeragi.md` §6.10): the lane's payload builder answers `EMPTY`
when the lane queue partition (§5) has nothing admissible.

### 3.2 Admission execution (execute-before-vote for lanes)

A lane member executes a lane block `B` at lane height `x` as follows; `Valid(R)` or `Invalid`:

1. The anchor is a committed `G` block the node has applied: `anchor_hash` is the hash of `G`
   height `anchor_height`. If the node has not applied that height yet, execution is **pending**
   (the executor answers when it has; the core allows execution to take time, §6.3). If the node
   applied that height with another hash, `Invalid`.
2. Monotone anchors: `anchor_height ≥` the anchor of lane block `x − 1` (from its `R` preimage).
3. The lane is active at the anchor: `active_from ≤ anchor_height` and not
   (`closing = Some(c)` with `anchor_height ≥ c`).
4. Every transaction is for this network and its signature verifies. Limits, expiry and every
   state check belong to merge execution (§4.3), where `G`'s parameters of the merge height apply.
5. No transaction hash appears earlier in `B`, or in one of the last `W = 64` lane blocks
   (`LANE_DEDUP_WINDOW`) whose anchor is at least `a(B) − A` — a block `G` may still merge fresh
   together with `B`. Once every earlier carrier is stale for `B`, the transaction may be carried
   again: a stale carrier never executes it. Duplicates across lanes, or of transactions `G`
   already committed, are dropped at merge.

`R_x = H("iroha/sumeragi/lane/result/v1" ‖ norito(LaneResult))` with
`LaneResult { anchor_height, anchor_hash, tx_hashes, payload_bytes, next_committee_digest, next_params }`;
`next_*` are the pinned constants (§2.3), so the core's lag-2 rule holds trivially.

Admission is a pure function of the lane block, the lane's own chain (its previous anchor and the
last `W` blocks with their anchors) and permanent facts of `G` (the anchor block's hash and time,
and this lane's record fields, which never change once set),
so every honest lane member computes the same `R_x` whenever it executes. Admission never reads
world state and never checks routing: routing is decided at merge (§4.3 step 3), where `G`'s
state is the single authority, so a lane's result cannot depend on how recent a node's view of
the lane set is.

## 4. Merging lanes into `G`

### 4.1 Nodes follow every lane

Every `G` node runs every active public lane's instance: as a member when its validator key is in
the pinned committee, otherwise as an observer (the core commits from CommitQCs and syncs bodies
as an observer, `sumeragi.md` §6.9). Lanes of restricted dataspaces are followed by the nodes the
dataspace policy admits; `G` merges only lanes its validators follow (public lanes in the first
release). A node starts a lane instance when it applies `G` height `active_from` and stops it after
applying the retirement height.

### 4.2 The `G` payload

A `G` block payload carries, besides its ordinary transactions (lane 0):

```text
LaneMerge { lane: LaneId, incarnation: [u8; 32], from: u64, to: u64, tip_hash: Hash, tip_result: Hash }
```

for each lane with new certified blocks: the next contiguous lane heights `from = merged + 1 ..= to`
that the leader's node has committed. The payload carries them in its execution context
(`SumeragiLaneMergeSection`), lanes in ascending `LaneId`. Limits: at most `max_merge_blocks`
(policy) lane blocks per lane, and the block's own transactions plus the transactions of its
fresh merged blocks fit the block's transaction capacity (the on-chain transaction cap and the
execution output's network input capacity), so a `G` block's execution stays within its budget.
The leader reserves capacity for lane blocks first, lanes taking turns (rotating by height) so
none starves, and fills the rest with lane-0 transactions. A block with merges and no
transactions of its own is work: lanes never wait for lane-0 traffic.

The section also declares a **time floor**: one millisecond after the latest creation time among
the transactions of its fresh merged blocks. The block's canonical time is at least the floor
(besides the parent-plus-cadence rule and its own transactions), so every merged transaction
precedes the block that executes it, and the proposal alone still fixes the time. Execution
recomputes the floor from the lane blocks; a different declaration makes the block `Invalid`.

### 4.3 Merge execution

`G`'s executor, for a `G` block at height `h`, after its ordinary preamble:

1. For each `LaneMerge` in order, the node's lane store must hold committed heights
   `from ..= to` (the executor waits up to `E_max`; until then execution is pending and retried —
   lane sync fetches them, and a lane CommitQC for them exists, so bodies are available from the
   lane committee). A `LaneMerge` out of lane order, whose lane has no record, another
   incarnation, is not active (`h ≤ active_from`), whose `from` is not `merged + 1`, whose `to`
   block or result differs from the lane's committed block, or which violates a limit makes the
   `G` block `Invalid`. A certified lane block whose payload is not a lane batch (only a
   Byzantine lane quorum certifies one) is merged without effect.
2. **Freshness:** a merged lane block is *stale* when `anchor_height < h − A`. A stale block is
   merged — the frontier moves past it, so a lane never stalls behind an old block — but its
   transactions are not executed; they stay pending in the queue and are proposed again. (Lane
   members refuse blocks anchored at or after a closing height `c`, so no merged block is.)
3. The transactions of the fresh merged lane blocks are executed in order — lanes ascending,
   lane heights ascending, transactions in batch order — after lane 0's transactions, exactly as
   if they were one ordered list in the `G` block: the executed block is the proposal with these
   entrypoints appended (`merged_count` records how many; removing them recovers the proposal).
   A merged transaction is dropped — no effect, no fee, not in the executed block — when
   `route(tx, state before h)` (§5.1) is not the lane that carried it (*misrouted*), the chain
   already committed it or it occurs earlier in the block (*duplicate*), or a block at `h` could
   not carry it (not an ordinary admission intent, created at or after the block time, or failing
   the network, signature, limit or expiry checks at the block time). Dropping instead of
   invalidating keeps a lane committee from blocking `G` with a transaction `G` refuses. Every
   other transaction executes and its outcome (accepted / rejected with reason, fees as usual)
   is committed in `R_h`. Admission at the lane does not guarantee acceptance: state may have
   changed since the anchor.
4. The **lane step** (in the execution output's finalizer, with the schedule step): the merged
   frontiers advance to `to` (`merged_at = h`, `rescued = 0`); the block's lane-0 transactions
   routed to another lane add to that lane's `rescued`; the load sample of §6.1 is recorded;
   lanes at their retirement height are removed; fixed lanes are reconciled with the policy;
   stalled lanes close (§6.4); at most one autoscale transition applies (§6.2–§6.3).

FASTPQ execution-source capture freezes these same committed native lane incarnations before
block-start effects. At height `h`, a nonzero lane uses its exact record only while it admits
anchor `h - 1`; lane 0 retains the global chain's original incarnation. Physical storage catalogs
do not grant execution-lane authority, and later lifecycle effects cannot change that frozen scope.

**Parallel execution.** Step 3 fixes the *result*: the canonical serial order above. The executor
may run merged lane batches concurrently with the deterministic parallel scheduler, which commits
a transaction only in canonical order and re-executes it on a read/write conflict with an earlier
one, so the result equals the serial order on every node and every machine. Lane key prefixes
(`LaneConfig::key_prefix`) and authority-based routing (§5.1) keep most lane batches disjoint, so
adding lanes adds execution parallelism as well as dissemination and certification capacity;
transactions that touch several lanes' state serialize on the conflict, never reorder.

A lane block that is stale when merged, or that is still unmerged when its lane retires, has no
effect; its transactions stay in the nodes' queues (§5.3) and are proposed again.

### 4.4 Why this is safe

- `G`'s CommitQC fixes the merge set and order; every honest `G` node executes the same
  transactions in the same order (the lane blocks are fixed by their lane CommitQCs, and the tip
  hash and result bind them). World state therefore stays a deterministic function of `G`'s
  committed chain.
- A lane's safety (one block per lane height) comes from its own core instance; `G` validators
  check nothing about lane signatures beyond their own nodes' lane commits, which are the core's
  commits under the pinned committee.
- A Byzantine `G` leader can only choose *how much* of each lane to merge (not reorder or alter
  it); honest leaders merge everything available, so every certified, fresh lane block is merged
  within one honest `G` leader's turn.

### 4.5 Storage and sync

The node's Kura stores `G` blocks as today and, per lane incarnation, a lane block store with one
certified frame per lane height (the same `KuraBlockStore` shape, under the lane instance's
storage identity). A `G` frame is committed only after the lane frames it merges are durable
(append order), so replay after restart re-executes `G` blocks from local lane frames. A syncing
node syncs each lane instance alongside `G` and executes a `G` block once its lanes reach the
merged tips; lane frames of retired incarnations are kept while any retained `G` block references
them and pruned with those `G` blocks.

## 5. Routing and the queue

### 5.1 Routing function

`route(tx, state) -> LaneId` at global height `h` uses only committed state. A lane is
*admitted* at `h` when its record admits blocks anchored at `h − 1`, the tip a block at `h` is
built on — so a lane receives traffic only once the global chain has applied its activation
height (and its instances run), and none from the height after its closing height. The policy's
explicit routes come first (an account matcher and/or an instruction matcher; the target is lane
`0` or a fixed lane, and a target that is not admitted sends the transaction to lane `0`);
otherwise the default route is sharded over lane 0 and the admitted elastic lanes by
`H(tx.authority) mod k` (authority-based sharding keeps one account's transactions in one lane,
preserving their order). A node routes new transactions with its latest applied `G` state; `G`
re-evaluates the route at merge (§4.3 step 3), so a transaction routed just before a lane opened
or closed is dropped as misrouted without effect, stays pending in the queue and is re-routed.

**Application policy.** A native lane determines ordering and execution provenance; the
transaction's physical application profile is independently selected by the deterministic Nexus
routing policy over the current execution state. Queue admission applies that physical profile,
and merge execution resolves it again. The physical plan must contain exactly one route; the
current executor rejects multi-route plans. Its dataspace must equal the authenticated native
execution route's dataspace. Manifest readiness, governance hooks, privacy, compliance and fraud
checks use the exact physical profile, including when its numeric lane identifier collides with
a native lane identifier. Execution source identity and output custody retain the native lane
and incarnation. No catalog-order choice or same-dataspace sibling substitutes for the selected
application profile.

The configured genesis signature authenticates bootstrap inputs before execution. Each input
carries a private admission capability bound to its exact header, transaction hash and position,
usable only while committed history is empty. This capability exempts that input from runtime
fraud-assessment metadata, which the canonical genesis envelope cannot carry. Ordinary execution,
including an isolated component with a height-one header, retains the configured fraud policy.

**Rescue.** `G` does not enforce routes on its own transactions. A leader includes a transaction
routed to another lane once it is older than `2A` global block times (by its creation time
against the parent block's): a stalled lane cannot hold transactions, and each rescued
transaction is committed evidence of load the lane is not serving (§6.4). A transaction both
rescued and carried by a lane executes once; the later carrier's copy is a duplicate.

### 5.2 Queue partitions

The transaction queue keeps one FIFO partition per lane (lane 0 is `G`'s). Gossip, admission
limits and expiry are per node as today; the partition is derived by `route` when a transaction
is admitted and recomputed when the catalog changes (after a lane opens or closes).

### 5.3 Retirement from the queue

A transaction leaves the queue when a `G` block that executed it (merged or directly) is applied.
It is not removed when a lane block containing it commits: until `G` merges that block the
transaction is still pending, and if the block is never merged it is proposed again. The lane
payload builder skips transactions already in committed-but-unmerged lane blocks of that lane.

## 6. Autoscale

All rules run in `G`'s execution with committed data only; every node computes the same decision.
Parameters are the policy's `autoscale` settings (elastic range `[min_lane, max_lane_exclusive)`,
dataspace, committee size, per-lane target throughput, window, scale-out and scale-in
utilization in per mille, cooldown); at most one autoscale transition per `G` block.

### 6.1 Samples

Each `G` block appends a sample `{height, time_ms, transactions, lanes}` — the transactions it
executed from lane 0 and the elastic lanes, and the number of default-route lanes (lane 0 plus
the admitted elastic lanes) — keeping the last `window + 1`. Utilization over the window is

```text
Σ transactions / Σ (interval_ms × lanes × per_lane_target_tps / 1000)      (per mille)
```

over the last `window` sample intervals. Blocks are work-driven (no empty blocks), so a long
block interval means idle time, not saturation: latency is not a load signal, and utilization
already counts the idle time as unused capacity.

### 6.2 Scale out

When utilization is at least `scale_out_permille`, the cooldown has expired and a free elastic id
exists, execution creates a lane record: the lowest free id, the autoscale dataspace, the
policy's lane parameters and `A`, a fresh incarnation, and a committee of `committee_size`
global validators live at `h` with their registered proofs of possession, ranked by
`H("iroha/sumeragi/lane/committee-rank/v1" ‖ ι ‖ key)` (so successive lanes spread over the
validator set) and stored in canonical order. If fewer validators are available, no lane is
created.

### 6.3 Scale in and retirement

When utilization is below `scale_in_permille` (strictly below `scale_out_permille`, so a
transition never immediately reverses) and the cooldown has expired, execution sets
`closing = Some(h + 1)` on the highest active, non-closing elastic lane. From `c`:
routing excludes the lane (§5.1), lane members refuse blocks anchored at or after `c` (§3.2
step 3), and `G` merges only its blocks anchored before `c` (§4.3). At `G` height `c + A` every
still-unmerged block of the lane is stale, so its frontier is final; at `c + A + 1` execution
removes the record and the lane retires. No drain vote or certificate exists: `G` alone decides
the frontier.

### 6.4 Stalled lanes

A lane with rescued load (`rescued > 0`, §5.1) whose frontier has not advanced for
`stall_window` `G` blocks (`h ≥ merged_at + stall_window`) is closed exactly like a scale-in
(fixed lanes too), so a lane whose pinned committee lost its quorum is replaced. A fixed lane is
then recreated with the committee the policy lists; governance replaces a broken committee by
changing the policy.

## 7. Fees and settlement

Lane transactions pay fees at merge execution like any transaction (the fee model of
`nexus_fee_model.md`). Fee admission uses the transaction's dataspace, which must agree between
the physical application policy and authenticated native execution route (§5.1). There are no
lane relay envelopes, settlement receipts or FASTPQ relay proofs: `G` executes the transactions
itself.

## 8. Status and telemetry

`/v1/sumeragi/status` stays the status of `G`'s instance. `/v1/sumeragi/lanes` serves one
`SumeragiLaneStatus` per lane of the committed state: its record (lane, dataspace, incarnation,
pinned committee and parameters, activation, closing, merged frontier, stall bookkeeping) and the
status of the node's instance of it (the same `SumeragiStatus` as `G`'s, or none before the
instance runs). Lane instances report through the node's log observer like `G`.

`/v1/sumeragi/diagnostics` reports pressure from its live Queue owner, committed NPoS
parameters and physical lane governance. It does not retain synthetic lane/dataspace
commitment or pipeline snapshots from the retired driver. A missing Queue owner is
unavailable rather than an empty queue. Account dataspace summaries expose bindings,
portfolio counters and manifest state; native lane incarnation/frontier information
comes from `/v1/sumeragi/lanes`. These diagnostics do not qualify RS16 availability.

## 9. What lanes do not have

There is no lane-level vote on world state, no second (merge) quorum certificate, no merge leader,
no side-channel custody of lane bodies, no drain vote or certificate, no relay envelope or relay
settlement proof, and no per-transaction queue reservation protocol: `G`'s CommitQC orders the
merge, the lane instances' own commits make lane bodies available to every node, and the closing
height plus the freshness bound fix a closing lane's frontier. Cross-lane atomicity is that of the
`G` block; atomicity across dataspaces with separate state is §11's two-phase commit. The lane and
dataspace catalogs, `LaneConfig` geometry (key prefixes, visibility, storage profile), routing
rules, the `nexus.autoscale` parameters, lane validator pools and committee selection, and the
Kura per-instance storage identity are the inputs this design builds on.

## 10. Implementation plan

Done (`crates/iroha_core/src/sumeragi/lanes/`, `crates/iroha_data_model/src/sumeragi_lanes.rs`):

- **Lifecycle state and policy:** `SumeragiLaneState` in World, the `sumeragi_lane_policy`
  parameter and its validation, lane identity and `Init`/configuration from the record.
- **Lane executor and payload builder:** `LaneBatch`, admission and `R`, the anchor-aware
  dedupe window, the durable per-incarnation block store, routing from committed state.
- **`G` merge:** the merge section, pending-until-committed execution with the node's lane
  stores (also during Kura replay), freshness, dropping rules, canonical execution order,
  capacity reservation, rescue.
- **Lane step:** frontiers, samples, retirement, fixed-lane reconciliation, stall close,
  autoscale with committee selection.

Remaining:

1. **Multi-instance node (S5 core):** the node runs `G` plus one driver instance per active lane
   (per-instance records, bodies and the shared lane store; observer labels), started when `G`
   applies `active_from` and stopped after retirement; `net.rs` routes frames by instance id;
   O9 isolation tests.
2. **Status, telemetry, Torii and SDK DTOs; kagami/localnet lane policies.**
3. **Tests:** a P2P network soak with elastic scale-out and scale-in under load and restarts
   (in-process four-validator node tests and the simulator's F38 — a lane next to `G`, followed by
   every node — already pass).

# Android Manifest & ISI Codegen Parity Inventory (AND3)

Roadmap item **AND3 — Scope manifest/ISI codegen parity** requires a single
reference describing which instructions already ship through the Android
codegen/export pipeline and what remains to be generated (especially fees,
manifest workflows, and governance payloads). This note captures the current
state of the artifacts under `target-codex/android_codegen/` and threads the
remaining work into concrete generator + fixture tasks so the Kotlin/Java
builders can stay aligned with the Rust data model.

## 1. Inputs & Evidence

- The generated Android manifest projection enumerates **110**
  `InstructionBox` entries with discriminants, schema hashes, enum layouts, and
  Rust type names exported by `norito_codegen_exporter`
  (`tools/norito_codegen_exporter/src/main.rs`). Each entry now carries a
  schema-derived summary when rustdoc text is unavailable, eliminating the
  earlier `TODO` placeholders.
- `target-codex/android_codegen/builder_index.json` lists the generated Kotlin /
  Java builders plus package names, feature gates, and stability annotations
  consumed by `scripts/android_codegen_docs.py` (and surfaced in
  `specs/sdk/android/generated/` via `make android-codegen-docs`).
- `target-codex/android_codegen/instruction_examples/` carries one Norito JSON
  example per discriminant. The file names mirror the Rust type paths, which
  lets CI diff fixture drift deterministically.
- `cargo run -p xtask --features dev-tools --bin xtask -- norito-rpc-fixtures` is the sole owner of
  signed fixture publication. It writes the canonical corpus to
  `fixtures/norito_rpc/`, publishes the generated Java resource mirror, and
  publishes descriptor-only mirrors for Python and Swift. Android resources are
  outputs of that run, never canonical inputs.

## 2. Instruction Coverage Snapshot

- The 110 discriminants span 18 generator families sourced from
  `crates/iroha_data_model/src/isi/`, and every discriminant has a builder
  entry. The four boxed helpers use the short wire IDs `iroha.grant`,
  `iroha.revoke`, `iroha.set_key_value`, and `iroha.remove_key_value` while
  mapping to their fully qualified Rust types.
- Every discriminant already has a Norito example file, so fixture generation is
  complete from Rust’s perspective. Android needs to bundle these examples into
  a signed manifest per release (see §4).

| Module | Count | Example discriminants |
|---|---:|---|
| `transparent` | 23 | iroha.custom, iroha.execute_trigger |
| `register` | 16 | iroha.register, iroha.unregister |
| `zk` | 7 | CancelConfidentialPolicyTransition, CreateElection |
| `sorafs` | 15 | ApprovePinManifest, BindManifestAlias |
| `governance` | 6 | CastPlainBallot, ProposeDeployContract |
| `kaigi` | 7 | CreateKaigi, EndKaigi |
| `ministry` | 1 | SubmitAgendaProposal |
| `mint_burn` | 6 | iroha.burn, iroha.mint |
| `transfer` | 6 | iroha.transfer, iroha.transfer_batch |
| `smart_contract_code` | 8 | ActivateContractInstance, UploadSmartContractCodeChunk |
| `repo` | 3 | iroha.repo.initiate, iroha.repo.reverse |
| `runtime_upgrade` | 3 | iroha.runtime_upgrade.activate, iroha.runtime_upgrade.cancel |
| `settlement` | 3 | iroha.settlement.dvp, iroha.settlement.pvp |
| `verifying_keys` | 2 | RegisterVerifyingKey, UpdateVerifyingKey |
| `GrantBox` | 1 | iroha.grant |
| `RemoveKeyValueBox` | 1 | iroha.remove_key_value |
| `RevokeBox` | 1 | iroha.revoke |
| `SetKeyValueBox` | 1 | iroha.set_key_value |

The first-release Android projection intentionally omits the generic shield,
shielded-transfer, and unshield discriminants. Confidential movement remains on
the typed Kagemusha top-up/redemption lifecycle; its proof artifacts are not
generic transaction builders.

## 3. Fees, Manifest & Governance Payloads

### 3.1 Trading & Fee-Bearing Flows

- **Repo instructions (`repo.rs`).** `RepoIsi` carries the complete immutable
  proposal, while `ReverseRepoIsi` carries only the agreement identifier and
  settles the stored terms at maturity
  (`crates/iroha_data_model/src/isi/repo.rs`). Android codegen must emit
  builders for the proposal and the ID-only maturity instruction, with Norito
  examples covering bilateral and tri-party owner-issued consent. Fixture plan:
  extend the canonical fixture definitions and
  `tools/norito_codegen_exporter/src/norito_rpc.rs`, then run the xtask owner so
  repo-specific vectors enter `fixtures/norito_rpc/` and every generated SDK
  mirror in one publication. Do not introduce an Android-owned fixture path.
- **Settlement instructions (`settlement.rs`).** DVP/PVP payloads plus the
  generic `SettlementInstructionBox` are already exported, but Android still
  needs typed builders covering `SettlementPlan`, `SettlementLeg`, and metadata
  (see `crates/iroha_data_model/src/isi/settlement.rs`). Fee coverage relies on
  stitching both legs into a single Norito frame, so the fixture bundler must
  emit dual-leg samples with deterministic metadata.

### 3.2 Manifest / Pinning Surfaces

- **SoraFS pin manifests (`sorafs.rs`).** Instructions such as
  `RegisterPinManifest`, `IssueReplicationOrder`, and
  `RecordCapacityTelemetry` (all in `crates/iroha_data_model/src/isi/sorafs.rs`)
  depend on Norito manifests produced by `sorafs_manifest`. Android builders
  need to expose the same `ManifestV1`, `PinPolicy`, and telemetry fields that
  Rust serializes. Action items:
  1. ✅ `scripts/android_codegen_docs.py` now inlines the manifest field tables,
     so operator SDKs can audit rollout knobs without reading the Rust sources.
     The generator emits dedicated sections for `PinPolicy`, `ChunkerProfileHandle`,
     `ManifestAliasBinding`, and `StorageClass`, and the rendered reference captures
     the same table data that the roadmap called out.【scripts/android_codegen_docs.py:134】【specs/sdk/android/generated/instructions.md:903】
  2. ✅ Replay the shared fixture in `fixtures/sorafs_orchestrator/` via
     `scripts/android_codegen_replay_sorafs_fixture.py`. The helper calls
     `sorafs_manifest_builder` with the multi-provider payload, stores the full
     manifest report under
     `target-codex/android_codegen/sorafs_manifest/multi_peer_parity_v1.json`,
     emits the tracked sample at
     `specs/sdk/android/generated/fixtures/sorafs_register_pin_manifest_multi_peer_parity_v1.json`,
     and injects a `fixture_example` block into the RegisterPinManifest example
     so the Android builders can hydrate real manifest data. A dedicated pytest
     (`scripts/tests/android_sorafs_fixture_example_test.py`) loads the fixture,
     chunker profile, and generated example to ensure the digests, policy knobs,
     and canonical manifest bytes match the multi-peer scenario. The instruction
     intentionally omits a submission epoch because Core derives it from the
     block consensus timestamp.
  3. ✅ Manifest lifecycle coverage now includes approval, retirement, and alias
     binding: the Android SDK exposes typed builders for
     `ApprovePinManifest`, `RetirePinManifest`, and `BindManifestAlias`
     (`java/iroha_android/src/main/java/org/hyperledger/iroha/android/model/instructions/ApprovePinManifestInstruction.java`,
     `java/iroha_android/src/main/java/org/hyperledger/iroha/android/model/instructions/RetirePinManifestInstruction.java`,
     `java/iroha_android/src/main/java/org/hyperledger/iroha/android/model/instructions/BindManifestAliasInstruction.java`).
     Registration, approval, and retirement builders do not accept lifecycle
     epochs; argument-map decoders reject those retired keys and Core records
     the corresponding consensus timestamp.
     Note: transaction encoding now requires wire-framed instruction payloads;
     the argument-map helpers are retained only for parity checks. Round-trip
     tests live under
     `java/iroha_android/src/test/java/org/hyperledger/iroha/android/sorafs/SorafsManifestInstructionBuilderTests.java`
     so CI will fail if the Norito arguments diverge from the Rust schema hashes.

- **Smart-contract uploads (`smart_contract_code.rs`).** The doc generator now
  renders the `ContractManifest`, `AccessSetHints`, and
  `EntrypointDescriptor` tables directly from
  `instruction_manifest.json` so the ABI/code-hash invariants baked into
  `crates/iroha_data_model/src/isi/smart_contract_code.rs` are spelled out
  alongside each instruction. The shared sample hash pair derived from
  `defaults/executor.to` is generated by
  `cargo run --locked -p ivm --features dev-tools --bin ivm_fixture_export -- --write` (and checked
  with the corresponding `--check` mode) under
  `specs/sdk/android/generated/fixtures/smart_contract_code_executor_hashes.json`,
  and `scripts/android_codegen_docs.py` links to that fixture so readers can
  verify their `.to` parsing logic without re-deriving the Blake2b/ABI digests.

### 3.3 Governance & Runtime Inputs

- **Kaigi governance (`kaigi.rs`).** `CreateKaigi`, `RecordKaigiUsage`, and
  relay-management instructions (see `crates/iroha_data_model/src/isi/kaigi.rs`)
  must be called out explicitly because they share telemetry proofs across SDKs.
  Builders should surface relay manifest hashes and usage counters so Kaigi
  audits stay deterministic.
- **Runtime upgrades (`runtime_upgrade.rs`).** `ProposeRuntimeUpgrade`,
  `ActivateRuntimeUpgrade`, and `CancelRuntimeUpgrade` discriminate runtime
  payloads with `abi_hash` gating. Android builders must embed the hash
  validation rules described in `specs/ivm.md` and reuse the Norito
  fixture used by the Rust admission tests.
- **Governance drafts (`governance.rs`).** ✅ Android now ships typed builders for
  `ProposeDeployContract`, `CastZkBallot`, `CastPlainBallot`, `EnactReferendum`,
  `FinalizeReferendum`, and `PersistCouncilForEpoch`. The generated reference documents their
  schema hashes, while `java/iroha_android/src/test/java/org/hyperledger/iroha/android/governance/GovernanceInstructionBuilderTests.java`
  exercises round-trip coverage so SDK integrations stay aligned with the Rust data model.

## 4. Generator & Fixture Outputs

1. **Doc extraction.** `norito_codegen_exporter` now accepts `--doc-json <path>`
   and uses the supplied rustdoc JSON to populate the `documentation` field for
   every instruction. Generate the JSON via
   `cargo +nightly rustdoc -p iroha_data_model -- -Zunstable-options --output-format json`
   (the file lands under `target/doc/iroha_data_model.json`) and pass that path
   when invoking the exporter so `scripts/android_codegen_docs.py` can drop the
   `TODO` placeholders automatically.
2. **Manifest-aware builder docs.** Update the generator to include enum layout
   tables (tags/payloads) for `sorafs`, `repo`, `settlement`, and governance
   instructions. This keeps the Kotlin/Java builders self-explanatory without
   reading the Rust source.
3. **Fixture bundler.** `scripts/android_codegen_fixtures.py` now zips the
   contents of `target-codex/android_codegen/instruction_examples/` into
   `artifacts/android/codegen_fixtures/<timestamp>/instruction_examples.zip`,
   writes the SHA-256 sidecar, and records `metadata.json`. CI can call this
   helper before publishing SDK parity fixtures.
4. **CI gate.** The OpenAPI release-input workflow runs
   `bash ci/check_android_codegen.sh`. The gate clones the exact clean commit
   twice without hard links, seals both source mirrors read-only, assigns each
   replay a fresh external `/private/tmp/.../target`, and routes both Cargo
   invocations through the shared pinned no-interference policy. Generated docs
   and parity summaries stay out of tree and must agree with each other and the
   checked-in files byte-for-byte. Standalone runs create an all-or-none
   authenticated artifact/cancellation channel pair; inherited runs must supply
   both. The retained work root contains the raw stages, while the log,
   deterministic archives, summaries, and final `COMPLETED.json` receipt remain
   below the authenticated artifact root. Completion publication is bracketed
   by cooperative cancellation checks that never interrupt an in-flight child.
   The gate reports both authenticated channel paths before replay begins.
5. **Recorded metadata.** `specs/sdk/android/generated/codegen_manifest_metadata.json`
   now stores the blessed SHA-256 digests and entry counts for the instruction
   manifest and builder index. The helper `scripts/check_android_codegen_parity.py`
   ingests those values and emits a parity summary (see `make android-codegen-verify`),
   failing the build when regenerated manifests drift from the recorded hashes.

## 5. Next Steps & Owners

Closed: the generator, fixtures, documentation, and CI gate are all in place.
Future schema changes should follow the change-log workflow
(`specs/sdk/android/norito_instruction_changes.md`). Generate reviewed candidate
outputs out of tree first; update recorded hashes and docs only after the two
independent sealed replays are byte-identical. The developer make targets use
`scripts/sumeragi_v2_release_cargo_proxy.sh` and therefore require a fresh,
owner-private external `CARGO_TARGET_DIR`.

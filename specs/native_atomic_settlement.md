# Native atomic settlement: first-release contract

This specification accompanies the proposed `SettleAtomic` implementation.
Native compilation and real-network qualification remain required before the
candidate is accepted. The transparent instruction and the confidential
protocol in `private_settlement.md` have different authorization and state
representations; the benchmark compares an identical economic payment vector.

## Signed intent and canonical representation

`SettleAtomic` contains exactly `network_id`, `settlement_id`, `movements`,
`expires_at_height` and `metadata`. The network is identified by genesis.
Expiry is inclusive: execution at the signed height is allowed; execution at
a greater height fails. A successful receipt permanently occupies the business
identifier, so the same identifier cannot execute a second time.

`AtomicSettlementMovements` contains 2 through 255 movements. Each movement is
an exact source `AssetId`, a canonical domainless recipient `AccountId`, and a
positive `Quantity`. The destination has the source's asset definition and
explicit balance scope. Account aliases, ambient lane context and an asset's
display name cannot substitute another bucket. Self-transfers, duplicate
movement keys and unsorted vectors are rejected. Ordering is strictly by
`(source, recipient)`; implementations must not sort an incoming signed value.

Norito binary decoding bounds the vector before allocation and validates its
contents. The canonical layout carries its decode flags; missing scope fields
or alternative layouts are not inferred. JSON uses the same exact closed
fields and validated model. The JavaScript JSON boundary belongs to
`iroha_js_codec`; the host does not maintain a second settlement codec.

The consent digest is `Hash::new_from_chunks` over
`iroha:settlement:atomic-intent:v1\0` and the complete canonical Norito
instruction frame. Consequently network, business identifier, all movements,
expiry and metadata are covered together. It is not a digest of just the
consenting owner's movement.

## Authorization, preparation and application

The transaction authority authorizes debits from its own buckets. Each other
debited bucket requires a live owner-issued `CanExecuteSettlement` permission
binding that exact bucket, business identifier and complete intent hash.
Admission and execution check current consent in their own immutable logical
state view. An earlier admission does not preserve a revoked permission.

Core prepares the complete numeric movement batch in one `StateTransaction`.
Every destination account must already exist. Existing balance policy, transfer
controls, numeric limits and protected reserves still apply. Aggregate outgoing
obligations for each source must be funded by its pre-settlement balance;
incoming movements cannot finance another outgoing obligation in the batch.

Preparation validates every movement, combined transfer-control update and its
bounded serialization before application. It retains the exact signed source
and destination buckets, pre-state balances and one authenticated transfer
transcript. A late invalid movement therefore rejects the complete batch before
an earlier movement can become visible. The receipt is constructed before the
first balance mutation and inserted after successful batch application.

Routing collects every explicit movement scope. A single scoped dataspace can
execute locally; multiple scopes or any Global balance require the universal
coordinator. Direct instructions and `SettlementInstructionBox::Atomic` resolve
to the same routes, fee operation and execution checks.

## Receipt and query boundary

`SettlementDetails::Atomic` stores the complete validated
`ResolvedSettlementMovements` and the intent hash. Each resolved movement
records the exact source, destination and positive quantity; atomic movements
have no separate per-leg metadata. Shared receipt consumers iterate the full
movement vector, including the 255-movement limit, rather than assuming a pair.

Each `SettlementDetails` variant carries one typed record with closed fields.
The FX outcome has two resolved movements and a mandatory
`FxCorridorPricingContext`; pricing context does not duplicate movement data.
These records use the ordinary schema generator and canonical Norito codecs.

`FindSettlementReceiptById` is a singular, read-only query under the existing
AllLedger permission class. Missing receipts fail without inserting state.
The singular-query output owner checks source, frame and allocation limits
before cloning the value. A returned receipt cannot mutate retained history.

## Matched benchmark workload

For each supported real topology `N = 2, 3, 4, 8, 16`, both profiles use N
primary payments plus one sponsor reimbursement from the first participant's
source. This is N+1 economic movements; it is not N-1 bilateral star transfers.
The same deterministic workload identity fixes payer/recipient keys, asset
definitions, explicit scopes, amounts, warmup flag and session attempt index.
Each confidential leg keeps its existing fixed two-input/three-output relation.

The transparent profile submits one consented atomic instruction for that full
vector. The confidential profile applies the corresponding private payments
and reimbursement through its existing governance, proof and carrier owners.
Both profiles use the same public genesis. Confidential prefunding uses a
separate synthetic pool initialization; it is not evidence of a deposit from
the public balances. Initialization is outside the measured settlement window
and must be retained in the experiment record.

One native worker owns one warmed network for a registered profile/N/seed
session. Its warmups precede measured attempts on that same network. Separate
session and attempt records bind actual process generations, dispatches,
measurements, terminal outcomes and accepted samples. An accepted sample is
retained even if delivery of its acknowledgement fails later. A live network
is not declared quiescent after an individual attempt.

Network bytes require an admitted packet-capture owner and exact listener and
process boundaries. CPU/RSS require the native process observer, including the
proof/coordinator work. Resource snapshots, packet records and matched economic
receipts are independently replayed before an accepted sample is emitted.
Source admission, ten fresh N=3 smoke completions, complete registered-scope
accounting and the release evidence verifier remain mandatory. Unit tests or
synthetic accounting fixtures do not establish any performance result.

TODO: Complete compilation, focused native tests and the admitted network
campaign on one settled source candidate. Until then this specification records
the proposed contract, not a passed release gate or a measured performance claim.

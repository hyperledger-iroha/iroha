# zk-X509 presentation interval

Source contract for task X.1 of the [ZK delivery plan](zk_delivery_plan.md). It
states which public presentation windows a zk-X509 credential admits, where
that is decided, and how builders and verifiers are kept in agreement. It makes
no proof-soundness, performance or deployment claim.

## Definition

One definition owns the predicate:
`crates/iroha_data_model/src/privacy/zk_x509_interval.rs`
(`PrivacyZkX509PresentationBoundsV1`, `PrivacyZkX509PresentationWindowV1`). It
takes already-parsed Unix seconds and is compiled in every build.

For a leaf-first path with validity periods `[notBefore_i, notAfter_i]` (both
inclusive) and its governed complete CRL `[thisUpdate, nextUpdate)`, a window
`[start, end]` of inclusive consensus seconds is admitted exactly when

| Predicate | Bound |
|---|---|
| shape | `start < end` and `end - start <= 300` |
| every certificate, lower | `start >= notBefore_i`, so `start >=` the **latest** `notBefore` |
| every certificate, upper | `end <= notAfter_i`, so `end <=` the **earliest** `notAfter` (leaf, intermediate or root) |
| CRL `thisUpdate`, inclusive | `start >= thisUpdate` |
| CRL `nextUpdate`, exclusive | `end < nextUpdate`; equality rejects |
| CRL age | `end - thisUpdate <= 300` |
| calendar | `end <= 253402300799` (`9999-12-31T23:59:59Z`) |

The bounds type names the two admissible window endpoints, not certificate
fields: `earliest_start` is the latest signed lower bound and `latest_end` is
the earliest signed upper bound. The shared vectors use the same two keys.

The executing block second `block_timestamp_ms / 1000` must lie in
`[start, end]`. With `TU`, `NU`, `PA` the CRL times and the public end, and
`Cmin` the earliest `notAfter` in the path, the last admissible block
timestamp is

```text
min(TU + 301, NU, Cmin + 1, PA + 1) * 1000 - 1   milliseconds
```

Revision 6 wrote `Cmax` (latest expiry) in this formula. That budgets a
deadline after an intermediate or root certificate has expired; presenting
such a credential is a security defect. Every other revocation predicate
(complete-CRL binding, serial non-membership, revocation precedence,
registration freshness) is unchanged.

## Where it is decided

`zk_x509_presentation_interval_sites.json` classifies every source file that
uses the window fields, the governed CRL update fields, the two ceilings or the
canonical API.

- `canonical` sites take their verdict or their chosen window from the
  definition. In every build: statement validation, authoritative-state
  admission and the verifier's public shape. Compiled with the prover only
  (`cfg(any(test, feature = "privacy-release-evidence"))`, recorded under
  `build_gates`): the native reference relation, the DER-to-bounds helper
  `derive_zk_x509_presentation_bounds_v1`, the release fixtures, and prover
  preflight, which calls state admission and the native relation. An ordinary
  build contains none of those four.
- `in-relation` sites (the DER/RFC 5280 AIR and its numeric relation slots) are
  deliberately independent formulations: one lower and one upper slot per
  certificate, a strict `nextUpdate` slot and a `thisUpdate + 300` slot. Tests
  compare them with the definition; they share only its constants.
- `deferred` sites compute by hand what the definition computes and do not call
  it yet: CRL registration and rotation freshness in the ISI executor
  (`validate_zk_x509_crl_freshness_v1`), the release-evidence submission
  deadline, and the deadline and expected window in the four-peer network
  test. Each is pinned to its reviewed source lines and carries a `TODO(X.6)`.

State admission sees the public window and the governed CRL record. The
certificate validity periods are private, so only the proof binds them: a
window past a private certificate expiry passes state admission and is
rejected by the relation.

No SDK builds an X509 statement today. A builder added with X.5 parses the
validity fields, then calls the definition (Rust) or reproduces the shared
vectors (other languages), and must be added to the site inventory. X.5 also
owns shipping the DER-to-bounds helper together with the holder prover.

## Holder privacy

The window is public and the certificate validity dates are private. When a
certificate, not the public CRL, is the binding bound, the widest window ends
exactly at the earliest `notAfter`, and a window that starts at
`earliest_start` starts exactly at the latest `notBefore`. Either publishes an
exact private date. It can only happen within 300 seconds of an expiry or an
issuance. `window_publishes_private_bound` reports it from the combined
bounds, the CRL-only bounds and the window; a `false` result is not a general
privacy guarantee. Whether a wallet refuses or presents a shorter window is
X.5 policy.

## Checks

- `python3 scripts/check_zk_x509_presentation_interval.py` (run by `make guards`
  and the PR workflow) — independent per-interval oracle against
  `fixtures/zk/x509/interval_vectors_v1.json`, and the site inventory against
  the source tree.
- `cargo test -p iroha_data_model --test zk_x509_presentation_interval` —
  definition, vectors, exhaustive boundary grid, deadline, the latest-expiry
  regression, the disclosure predicate and the deferred-site boundary grid.
- `cargo test -p iroha_core_privacy --lib presentation_interval_tests` —
  genuinely signed paths with the earliest expiry and latest `notBefore` at
  the leaf, intermediate and root; boundary equality; one-second overflow;
  `nextUpdate` exclusion; the DER-to-bounds helper, native relation, state
  admission, prover preflight, DER AIR and numeric rows all agree.
- `cargo test -p iroha_core_privacy --lib forged_window_end` — the RFC 5280 AIR
  base constraints over rows forged for a window end past the earliest expiry
  (leaf, intermediate, root), at `nextUpdate`, and past the CRL age.
- `cargo test -p iroha_core_privacy --lib relation_slot_schedule` — the
  verifier-fixed slot schedule equals the definition on the boundary grid.

What the site check does and does not establish:

- The scan is a name tripwire over the identifier spellings in `pattern`. Code
  that computes a window under other names is not found; the shared vectors
  and each builder's conformance tests are the control for that.
- Roles are reviewed classifications. Mechanically checked: every scanned file
  is classified and no entry is stale; a `canonical` site calls the canonical
  API and a non-test site that calls it is `canonical`; `in-relation` sites
  are in the engine; test files carry `test`; each `deferred` site still
  contains its pinned lines, and the boundary-grid test still transcribes
  them; each `build_gates` declaration is still in the source.

## Open

- No complete X5S1 proof was generated for the new path shapes; proving at
  these shapes belongs to X.3/X.4. The constraint-level tests cover the base
  (challenge-independent) residues; the slack-to-range copy is an auxiliary
  bus, shown there by its tuple columns and not by a proof.
- The `deferred` sites are not migrated. The ISI predicate equals
  `from_crl(...)` containing the block second for every block second within the
  RFC 5280 calendar; the definition additionally rejects a later second. X.6
  owns the migration and end-to-end deadline budgeting.
- The DER-to-bounds helper and prover preflight are absent from ordinary
  builds until X.5 ships the holder prover.

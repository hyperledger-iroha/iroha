# ZK Envelopes (Norito)

This page specifies Norito-encoded envelopes used by native verifiers in the
Iroha 3 codebase. Envelopes are versioned, deterministic, and designed to be
portable between components (clients, IVM, node).

Scope (current)
- IPA (transparent; no trusted setup): non-privacy polynomial opening proofs
  admitted under the exact `halo2/ipa` verifier label. Privacy protocols use
  their protocol-specific typed verifiers and cannot be selected through this
  generic envelope. Envelope type: `OpenVerifyEnvelope`.
- STARK (FRI-style): binary-FRI consistency proofs over a 2^k Goldilocks domain
  using the canonical six-lane Poseidon-x7 digest and an Fp4 transcript.

Backends (tags)
- Generic non-privacy IPA verifier entrypoint: `halo2/ipa`
  - The envelope selects the concrete curve/backend with `curve_id`
    (`1 = Pallas`, `2 = Goldilocks`, `20 = BN254`).
- STARK (native): `stark/fri/poseidon-x7-goldilocks-6x64-v1`

General notes
- Norito encoding is used for the envelopes and their nested payloads. Unless
  otherwise specified, scalars are little-endian and sized as per struct types.
- Determinism: challenges are derived from fixed transcript labels and byte
  sequences; native STARK hashing uses the single six-lane construction below
  and IPA uses SHA3 where specified by its statement.
- Size limits and validation: implementers must bound vector sizes and reject
  malformed payloads early (see code for current limits). The native verifier
  applies `StarkVerifierLimits` (envelope byte budget, domain/tag length, fold
  arity, queries, Merkle depth, auxiliary terms) inside
  `verify_stark_fri_envelope_with_limits`, with defaults used by the standard
  `verify_stark_fri_envelope` entrypoint.

## IPA: Polynomial Opening Envelope

Wire types (as implemented in `crates/iroha_zkp_halo2`)

- `IpaParams` (canonical transparent-parameter selector)
  - `version: u16` — format version, currently 1
  - `curve_id: u16` — backend identifier (`1 = Pallas`, `2 = Goldilocks`, `20 = BN254`)
  - `n: u32` — vector length (power of two)

  Generator vectors are not part of the wire format. V1 defines exactly one
  transparent parameter set for each `(curve_id, n)`. For the production Pallas
  (Vesta commitment group) and BN254 backends, every point is independently
  derived with the backend's `CurveExt::hash_to_curve` map under
  `IROHA-ZK-HALO2-IPA-v1-generator`. The mapped message is
  `dst || 0x00 || u64_le(kind_len) || kind || u64_le(n) || u64_le(i)`, where
  `kind` is `G`, `H`, or `U`. If the map ever returns the identity, derivation
  retries with `message || 0xff || u64_le(counter)`, starting at counter 1. This
  prevents a prover from choosing bases or
  learning discrete-log relationships between them and avoids transmitting
  `O(n)` redundant point encodings. The optional additive Goldilocks backend
  cannot provide unknown-discrete-log bases and is compatibility-test-only, not
  a production commitment backend.

- `IpaProofData`
  - `version: u16` — format version, currently 1
  - `l: Vec<[u8; 32]>` — per-round L commitments (compressed curve points)
  - `r: Vec<[u8; 32]>` — per-round R commitments
  - `a_final: [u8; 32]` — final reduced scalar for witness vector
  - `b_final: [u8; 32]` — final reduced scalar for public vector

- `PolyOpenPublic`
  - `version: u16` — format version, currently 1
  - `curve_id: u16` — backend identifier
  - `n: u32` — vector length
  - `z: [u8; 32]` — evaluation point (canonical field encoding)
  - `t: [u8; 32]` — claimed evaluation f(z)
  - `p_g: [u8; 32]` — commitment to coefficients under `g`

- `OpenVerifyEnvelope`
  - `params: IpaParams`
  - `public: PolyOpenPublic`
  - `proof: IpaProofData`
  - `transcript_label: String` — bound by both prover and verifier
  - `vk_commitment: Option<[u8; 32]>` — optional outer VK commitment bound into the transcript
  - `public_inputs_schema_hash: Option<[u8; 32]>` — optional schema hash bound into the transcript
  - `domain_tag: Option<[u8; 32]>` — optional caller-defined domain separator bound into the transcript

Verifier behavior (native IPA)
- Re-derives the public vector b = [1, z, z^2, …, z^{n-1}].
- Derives the canonical `g`, `h`, and `u` generators from the advertised curve
  and `n`; there is no wire representation for alternate bases.
- Binds the claimed statement before the first Fiat-Shamir challenge:
  `transcript_label`, backend/`n`, the complete derived parameter fingerprint,
  `z`, `t`, `p_g`, and any present optional metadata fields (`vk_commitment`,
  `public_inputs_schema_hash`, `domain_tag`).
- Replays transcript rounds to fold generators and update Q.
- Checks the final relation holds with `(a_final, b_final)`.
- Deterministic transcript over SHA3-256 under crate-defined DST.
- Batch helpers: `iroha_zkp_halo2::batch::verify_open_batch` verifies multiple
  envelopes with default settings, while
  `verify_open_batch_with_options` accepts `BatchOptions` to force sequential
  execution or cap rayon parallelism via `Parallelism::{Sequential, Auto, Limited}`.

Example (Rust)
```rust
use iroha_zkp_halo2::{
    Params, PolyOpenTranscriptMetadata, Polynomial, PrimeField64, Transcript,
    norito_helpers as nh,
};
let n = 8; let params = Params::new(n).unwrap();
let coeffs = (0..n).map(|i| PrimeField64::from((i+1) as u64)).collect();
let poly = Polynomial::from_coeffs(coeffs);
let p_g = poly.commit(&params).unwrap();
let z = PrimeField64::from(3u64);
let mut tr = Transcript::new("IROHA-TEST-IPA");
let metadata = PolyOpenTranscriptMetadata {
    vk_commitment: Some([0x11; 32]),
    public_inputs_schema_hash: Some([0x22; 32]),
    domain_tag: Some([0x33; 32]),
};
let (proof, t) = poly.open_with_metadata(&params, &mut tr, z, p_g, metadata).unwrap();
let env = iroha_zkp_halo2::OpenVerifyEnvelope {
    params: nh::params_to_wire(&params),
    public: nh::poly_open_public::<iroha_zkp_halo2::backend::pallas::PallasBackend>(
        n,
        z,

    ),

    public_inputs_schema_hash: metadata.public_inputs_schema_hash,
    domain_tag: metadata.domain_tag,
};
let bytes = norito::to_bytes(&env).unwrap();

## STARK: FRI-Style Multi-Fold Envelope

Hashing and transcript
- Every leaf, node, root, public-statement commitment, query draw, and FRI
  challenge uses `GoldilocksDigest384V1`: six independently parameterized
  Poseidon-x7 lanes over `p = 2^64 - 2^32 + 1`, each with width 3, rate 2,
  capacity 1, 8 full rounds, and 57 partial rounds.
- Bytes use canonical seven-byte field packing with explicit length
  termination. A digest is encoded as six canonical little-endian Goldilocks
  words (48 bytes); words greater than or equal to `p` are rejected.
- Every invocation binds the Exact12 catalog commitment and typed protocol,
  profile, tree-role, transcript-phase, level, index, lane, and counter domains.
  Merkle roles distinguish FRI layers, AIR trace rows, AIR composition values,
  and auxiliary composition values.
- Per-layer challenges take four independent digest lanes as the coefficients
  of `Fp4 = Fp[U]/(U^4 - 7)`. Query-index draws use canonical rejection
  sampling and bind the label, selector-free parameters, query ordinal, retry
  counter, and all relevant roots.
- There is no hash selector or alternate native-STARK decoder. Pre-release
  selector-bearing parameter, verifier-key, proof, and envelope bytes fail
  canonical V1 decoding.

Wire types (as implemented in `iroha_core::zk_stark`)

- `StarkFriParamsV1`
  - `version: u16` — format version, currently 1
  - `n_log2: u8` — log2 of evaluation domain size
  - `blowup_log2: u8` — log2 blowup before FRI folding (e.g., 3 for 8×)
  - `fold_arity: u8` — FRI arity (power-of-two; current backend supports 2)
  - `queries: u16` — expected query count (must match `proof.queries.len()`)
  - `merkle_arity: u8` — Merkle branching factor (binary only in v1)

  - `version: u16`
  - `roots: Vec<GoldilocksDigest384V1>` — 48-byte Fp4 FRI layer roots from 0…L

- `FoldDecommitV1`
  - `j: u32` — index at this layer
  - `y0: GoldilocksFp4V1`, `y1: GoldilocksFp4V1` — four canonical
    little-endian Goldilocks coefficients for inputs at positions `(2*j, 2*j+1)`
  - `path_y0: MerklePath`, `path_y1: MerklePath`
  - `z: GoldilocksFp4V1` — domain-aware binary FRI fold
    `(y0 + y1)/2 + r_k * (y0 - y1)/(2x)`, where `x` is the domain element for
    the opened `(x, -x)` pair
  - `path_z: MerklePath` — Merkle path for `z` under `roots[k+1]`

- `StarkProofV1`
  - `version: u16`
  - `commits: StarkCommitmentsV1`
  - `queries: Vec<Vec<FoldDecommitV1>>` — one chain per query
  - `comp_values: Option<Vec<StarkCompositionValueV1>>` — optional composition leaves

- `StarkCompositionValueV1`
  - `leaf: u64` — Merkle leaf recorded under `comp_root`
  - `constant: u64` — constant term
  - `z_coeff: u64` — coefficient applied to the final folded `z`
  - `aux_terms: Vec<StarkCompositionTermV1>` — additional wire/value contributions
  - `path: MerklePath` — inclusion proof under `comp_root`

- `StarkCompositionTermV1`
  - `wire_index: u32` — caller-defined wire ordering (must be strictly increasing)
  - `value: u64` — auxiliary value contributed by this wire
  - `coeff: u64` — coefficient multiplied with the value

- `StarkVerifyEnvelopeV1`
  - `params: StarkFriParamsV1`
  - `proof: StarkProofV1`
  - `transcript_label: String`

Limits and validation
- Bounds enforced by the raw native verifier: `n_log2 ≤ 24`, `queries ≤ 64`,
  `layers ≤ 32`, `merkle depth ≤ 32`, `aux_terms ≤ 64`, `domain_tag` length ≤
  64 bytes. `merkle_arity` and `fold_arity` must both be `2`. Canonical ledger
  verifier keys require blowup 8 and at least 64 queries; the current exact
  profile fixes the verifier maximum to the same 64-query value.
- Query sampling and per-round challenges are domain-separated by `domain_tag`,
  the fixed profile, blowup, fold arity, query count, typed phases, and roots;
  mismatched headers or roots are rejected.
- Bad roots, broken Merkle paths, tampered folds, non-canonical field encodings, and
  query-count/profile mismatches are covered by `iroha_core::zk_stark` regression tests.

Verifier behavior (native STARK)
- For each query, replays all folds:
  - Verifies `y0`, `y1` Merkle openings under `roots[k]` and `z` under `roots[k+1]`.
  - Treats each layer as bit-reversed evaluation order, derives `x` from the
    bit-reversed pair index, and checks
    `z == (y0 + y1)/2 + r_k * (y0 - y1)/(2x)` in the field.
- If `comp_root` is present on a raw generic STARK envelope, verifies the
  composition leaf/path and checks it matches
  `constant + z_coeff * z_final + Σ coeff_i * value_i`. Auxiliary terms must appear
  in strictly increasing `wire_index` order.
- For the V1 verifier-owned binding AIR, compares every coordinate of each
  transcript-sampled current/next row with the deterministic row derived from
  the bound public digest. Public residuals are not compressed with fixed
  coefficients. The verifier also reconstructs the canonical full-domain trace
  root with a streaming Merkle accumulator and requires exact equality. It also
  reconstructs and exactly matches the Merkle root of the all-zero composition
  vector. Generic binding domains are therefore capped at `n_log2 = 12`; larger
  generic binding proofs and verifying keys fail closed. Explicit full-material
  AIR verification instead recomputes both roots from every supplied row and
  composition value; private profiles without that material still require a
  separately qualified degree argument.
- `OpenVerifyEnvelope` STARK verification rejects inner `comp_root`/`comp_values`
  sidecars. The high-level verifier reconstructs the V1 binding-AIR digest from
  backend, circuit id, VK hash, schema descriptor, and public input columns, and
  ZK-ACE wrappers reconstruct the ZK-ACE AIR/public-input digests from the outer
  public-input payload. The ZK-ACE engine currently rejects proving,
  verification, and activation as unavailable pending commitment remediation.
- Validation: query indices derive from the transcript label + params + roots; the verifier
  rejects mismatched `j`, missing folds, bad roots/paths, non-canonical field encodings,
  selector-bearing retired layouts, and mismatched query-count headers. Depth/size caps
  guard against oversized envelopes.

	Example (Rust)
	```rust
		use iroha_core::zk_stark::*;
		let n_log2 = 3u8; // domain size 8
		// Build layers 0..L (y0/y1 folds) and Merkle roots/paths externally
		let env = StarkVerifyEnvelopeV1 { /* fill params, proof, transcript */ };
		let bytes = norito::to_bytes(&env).unwrap();
		// Verify the raw envelope bytes with `verify_stark_fri_envelope(&bytes)`.
		// Note: `verify_backend(\"stark/fri/*\", ...)` expects a Norito `OpenVerifyEnvelope` wrapper.
		```

	STARK via `OpenVerifyEnvelope` (consensus / `verify_backend`)
	- `ProofBox.bytes` (outer payload): Norito `OpenVerifyEnvelope` with:
	  - `backend = BackendTag::Stark`
	  - `circuit_id = "stark/fri/<profile>:<circuit>"` (application-level identifier)
	  - `vk_hash = sha256("iroha:zk:v1:vk" || len(backend) || backend || len(vk_bytes) || vk_bytes)`
	  - `public_inputs = schema descriptor bytes` (stable policy-defined layout commitment)
	  - `proof_bytes = norito(StarkFriOpenProofV1 { version, public_inputs, envelope_bytes })`
	- `StarkFriOpenProofV1.public_inputs` carries the concrete public input values
	  (column-major 32-byte words) used for circuit/policy checks.
	- `StarkFriOpenProofV1.envelope_bytes` (inner payload): Norito `StarkVerifyEnvelopeV1`
	- `VerifyingKeyBox.bytes` (for `stark/fri/*`): Norito `StarkFriVerifyingKeyV1`
	  containing the expected `circuit_id` and the FRI parameter set (`n_log2`, `blowup_log2`,
	  `fold_arity`, `queries`, `merkle_arity`).
	  `VerifyingKeyBox.backend` must exactly match the `ProofBox.backend` /
	  `verify_backend` label.
	  Consensus `verify_backend("stark/fri/*", ...)` admission requires this payload
	  to satisfy the ledger-grade production FRI floors; PoC-sized domain/query
	  settings are rejected before wrapper verification.
- The verifier enforces that the outer wrapper metadata is bound into the inner STARK
  envelope (via `domain_tag`), that the inner envelope parameters match the VK payload,
  that the transcript label matches the canonical wrapper AIR domain
  (`IROHA-STARK-AIR-V1` or `IROHA-STARK-ZK-ACE-AIR-V1`), and that the AIR public
  digest matches the verifier-reconstructed generic binding or ZK-ACE statement.
- Runtime STARK guardrails require the outer `OpenVerifyEnvelope`, decode
  `StarkFriOpenProofV1` before verifier dispatch, and reject malformed outer or
  wrapper bytes, unsupported wrapper versions, and empty native STARK envelope
  bytes with zero-duration failures.
- Runtime OpenVerify guardrails also reject `ProofBox.backend`,
  `VerifyingKeyBox.backend`, or decoded envelope backend tags that do not match
  the selected production verifier family before dispatch. Halo2-family
  guardrails additionally bind decoded `OpenVerifyEnvelope.circuit_id` values to
  the requested backend label: concrete native Halo2 labels must normalize to the
  same circuit. The generic `halo2/ipa` entry point uses a closed v1 circuit
	  registry containing only IVM execution, Kaigi roster/usage, the
	  protocol-private confidential transfer/unshield circuits used by native
	  escrow, plus the authenticated Offline Cash V1 artifact set. Tiny arithmetic,
  anonymous-transfer demos, vote-bool demos, the historical IVM overlay-binding
  stand-in, retired recursive-spend labels, cross-family ids, and trusted-setup
  ids all fail before verifier dispatch. Prefixing or otherwise normalizing a
  retired id never makes it admissible. Packaged Halo2 verifier keys are also
  compared with the deterministic verifier key generated from the selected
  compiled circuit, so a parseable demo or attacker-controlled constraint
  system cannot be relabeled with an admitted production circuit id.
- Production Halo2 `ProofBox.bytes` is a canonical data-model
  `OpenVerifyEnvelope`. Its `public_inputs` field contains a schema descriptor,
  not the concrete instance columns. Every admitted circuit id normalizes to one
  closed, authoritative descriptor (IVM execution, Kaigi roster/usage,
  confidential transfer/full-unshield/change-unshield, or an authenticated
  Offline Cash V1 artifact role).
  Preverification, guardrails, final dispatch, and verifying-key record
  preparation require exact descriptor bytes or the Iroha hash of those bytes;
  arbitrary nonempty replacements and unmapped circuits fail closed.
- Kaigi commitment, nullifier, and usage `Hash` artifacts encode a canonical
  Pasta Fp scalar injectively. Starting from its 32-byte little-endian field
  representation, byte 31's seven used bits are shifted left once and bit 0 is
  set as Iroha's mandatory `Hash` marker. Verification shifts that byte right
  once and requires canonical `Fp::from_repr` decoding. Directly wrapping raw
  scalar bytes with `Hash::prehashed` is noncanonical because it overwrites
  scalar bit 248.
- Kaigi roster proof construction remains a candidate-only low-level facility.
  Production `ZkRosterV1` join admission rejects because the current instance
  columns do not bind the signed participant authority; a NIZK and its
  commitment/nullifier artifacts are transferable. Transparent Kaigi, usage
  proofs, and host-signed lifecycle operations are distinct paths and remain
  available. The exported JS and native roster builders reject rather than
  returning an envelope that ledger admission cannot use. A future roster
  profile must version the authority-bound instance schema and deterministic
  key together before enabling joins.
- `OpenVerifyEnvelope.proof_bytes` for production Halo2 contains exactly one
  strict ZK1 carrier ordered as `PROF` and then optional `I10P`. The historical
  binary `Halo2ProofEnvelope` is not accepted by production dispatch because its
  caller-controlled `n_in`, `n_out`, and lookup flags were not absorbed into the
  Halo2 transcript. The retired carrier and its parser are not part of the
  first-release API.
- Production Halo2 verifier-key bytes use a strict ZK1 carrier ordered as
  exactly one `IPAK`, one `CID1`, and one non-empty `H2VK`. `CID1` is the exact
  portable circuit identifier (for example, `halo2/pasta/ipa/kaigi-roster-v1`);
  whitespace and alternate spellings are rejected rather than normalized.
  Kaigi client fixtures hash this complete key carrier under its configured
  registry backend and place the resulting nonzero commitment in the canonical
  outer envelope.
- STARK `OpenVerifyEnvelope` construction, preverification, and guardrails bind
  circuit ids to the selected STARK family as well: the generic `stark/fri`
  entry point rejects circuit ids that advertise another proof family, including
  slash and colon forms such as `halo2/...`, `halo2:...`, and `kzg:...`;
  trusted-setup aliases such as `bn254`, `bls12_381`, `universal-srs`, and
  profile-prefixed `stark/fri/<profile>:structured-reference-string`; and
  profile-specific STARK backends reject decoded circuit ids that advertise a
  different STARK profile or the generic `stark/fri:` prefix.
- Generic STARK `OpenVerifyEnvelope` construction and verification reserve the
  ZK-ACE and BFV full-bootstrap circuit ids for their dedicated wrappers. BFV
  full-bootstrap native AIR proofs must use the BFV-specific full-material
  verifier path. The public-padding-only entry points reject unconditionally:
  sampled public rows do not establish low degree for hidden trace columns.
  Generic
  preverification rejects metadata-valid OpenVerify wrappers that advertise
  noncanonical ZK-ACE colon/slash aliases or the BFV full-bootstrap circuit id,
  including backend-prefixed colon/slash aliases, before deduplication. The
  canonical ZK-ACE id remains reserved for the ZK-ACE-specific wrapper. The BFV
  wrapper accepts only the base native AIR transcript label or canonical
  unpadded retry suffixes emitted by the prover, and rejects generic
  `comp_root`/`comp_values` sidecars instead of accepting auxiliary composition
  commitments on top of the verifier-reconstructed arithmetic trace. Malformed
  BFV proof/commitment version tags, missing or foreign AIR sections, root
  drift, query/opening count drift, duplicate openings, opened row/path drift,
  FRI base-value drift, STARK parameter-profile drift, and caller-supplied
  verifier-limit violations fail before native BFV acceptance. The governed
  full-material verifier performs the public structural checks, then
  reconstructs and exactly matches the complete trace and composition roots. A
  valid envelope also cannot be replayed with stale BFV prover-input material,
  including layout metadata, trace/AIR digests, trace rows, composition values,
  or prover/verifier proof-key roles.

- All structs carry the first-release `version = 1`. There is no compatibility
  decoder: changing the V1 layout requires regenerating fixtures, and retired
  pre-release bytes remain invalid.
- Query indices are derived deterministically from the transcript label, parameters,
  and commitment roots; the verifier recomputes the index and rejects envelopes whose
  payload `j` values do not match the derived result.

### Governance vote circuits

The first-release Halo2 registry does not admit the historical
`VoteBoolCommitMerkle` family. Those circuits were test fixtures with a toy
compressor, and one verifier key was previously reinterpreted as both the
`vote-ballot` and `vote-tally` role. Governance now requires exact, distinct
role identifiers; the retired Halo2 labels fail key registration, proof
attachment, preverification, and native dispatch. A future Halo2 governance
design must introduce independently reviewed semantic ballot and tally
circuits and add their exact identifiers to the closed registry.

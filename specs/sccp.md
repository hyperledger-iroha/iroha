# SCCP v1: SORA Cross-Chain Protocol (first release)

Status: normative design, first release, revision 5 (2026-10-05). Destinations
verify Taira's own Sumeragi `CommitQC`: a fixed-layout finality header `X` is
bound into every certified result, and there is no bridge key, attestation
transaction or attestor. Validators of a network with SCCP stay bonded and
slashable while any destination may still trust a committee generation that
contained them. Governance belongs to the SORA Parliament: binding juries use
anonymous on-chain ballots per `specs/parliament_private_ballot_design.md`,
there is no Parliament key or custodian, and destinations need no Parliament
key. A pause-only fast pause track complements it. SCCP registers no route
until the Parliament's post-quantum ballot exists (§10.2). Much of this
revision is not implemented yet: §12 records the implementation status of every
part, and §14 records the binding decisions. SCCP does not change generic
Sumeragi bridge finality (`specs/bridge_finality.md`) beyond the
certified-result layout of `specs/sumeragi.md` §4.1.1 and the consensus
signature suite of `specs/sumeragi.md` §1 item 6.

SCCP moves Taira XOR between the Taira Iroha network and three external
mainnets. The first release admits exactly these profiles:

| Profile | Tag | SCCP domain | Native identity |
|---|---|---|---|
| `sora-taira` | `0x40` | 0 | runtime `NetworkId` (genesis header hash) |
| `ethereum-mainnet` | `0x41` | 1 | EVM chain id 1 |
| `bsc-mainnet` | `0x42` | 2 | EVM chain id 56 |
| `ton-mainnet` | `0x44` | 4 | TON global id −239 |

Tag `0x43` and SCCP domain 5, which belonged to the removed TRON profile, are
unassigned, and every decoder rejects them. There are no testnet profiles, no
alias profiles and no compatibility layouts.

## 0. Conventions

- MUST, MUST NOT, SHOULD and MAY are used in the RFC 2119 sense.
- `‖` is byte concatenation. `u8`, `u16`, `u32`, `u64`, `u128` are unsigned
  integers encoded **big-endian** with exactly that width; `be32(x)` and
  `be64(x)` are the same encodings. `bytes32` is 32 raw bytes.
- `word(x)` is the 32-byte ABI word of one static value: an unsigned integer or
  `address` is left-zero-padded big-endian to 32 bytes, a `bytes32` is taken
  verbatim, and a `bool` is 0 or 1.
- `keccak256` is Ethereum Keccak-256 (not SHA3-256). `SHA-256` is FIPS 180-4.
  `H_iroha` is `iroha_crypto::Hash`: Blake2b-256 with the low bit of the last
  byte forced to 1. Taira-internal identifiers use `H_iroha`; contract-visible
  hashes use `keccak256` or `SHA-256` as stated. `ASCII("…")` is the literal
  byte string without terminator or length prefix.
- **BLS12-381** constants (golden tests MUST pin them against `blst`):

  ```
  p      = 0x1a0111ea397fe69a4b1ba7b6434bacd764774b84f38512bf6730d2a0f6b0f6241eabfffeb153ffffb9feffffffffaaab
  HALF_P = (p − 1) / 2
         = 0x0d0088f51cbff34d258dd3db21a5d66bb23ba5c279c2895fb39869507b587b120f55ffff58a9ffffdcff7fffffffd555
  g1.x   = 0x17f1d3a73197d7942695638c4fa9ac0fc3688c4f9774b905a14e3a3f171bac586c55e83ff97a1aeffb3af00adb22c6bb
  g1.y   = 0x08b3f481e3aaa0f1a09e30ed741d8ae4fcf5e095d5d00af600db18cb2c04b3edd03cc744a2888ae40caa232946c5e7e1
  −g1.y  = 0x114d1d6855d545a8aa7d76c8cf2e21f267816aef1db507c96655b9d5caac42364e6f38ba0ecb751bad54dcd6b939c2ca
  ```

- **Compressed points** use the ZCash serialization: G1 is 48 bytes and G2 is
  96 bytes, stored `x.c1 ‖ x.c0`. The top three bits of byte 0 are flags:
  `0x80` compressed, `0x40` infinity, `0x20` sign. The sign bit is 1 iff `y >
  HALF_P`; for G2 the comparison uses `c1`, or `c0` when `c1 = 0`.
- "Taira-internal" structures are Norito types (`norito::{Encode, Decode}`,
  `norito::json`) and are only ever interpreted by Taira nodes and Rust tools.
  Whenever a Taira-internal value is hashed, the input is the headered Norito
  frame (`norito::to_bytes`), which advertises its layout flags.
  "Contract-visible" structures have the explicit byte layouts in §3 and MUST
  NOT depend on Norito, Rust enum discriminants or JSON spelling.
- Heights, epochs and timestamps refer to Taira unless qualified. `t(h)` is the
  canonical `creation_time_ms` of block `h`, and `h_exec` is the height of the
  block that executes the rule being described. On destinations `now_ms` is
  `block.timestamp × 1000` (EVM) or `now() × 1000` (TON).
- A Taira height `h` is **durably final** on a node when Kura holds the
  certified `SignedBlockWire` frame of `h` (the Sumeragi core's commit
  certificate over the block, `specs/sumeragi.md`) and the node's state has
  applied `h`. The Sumeragi core applies only certified blocks, so a committed
  height never reverts. Everywhere in this spec, "committed" means durably
  final.
- **Epochs** are the fixed-length epochs of the Sumeragi core
  (`specs/sumeragi.md` §11.7): with genesis height `g` and the scheduled
  `epoch_length_blocks`, the genesis block and the first `epoch_length` heights
  after it form epoch 0, and each following run of `epoch_length` heights is
  the next epoch (`sumeragi_epoch(h, g, epoch_length)`). A height is an epoch
  **boundary** iff it is the last height of its epoch. Committees change only
  at certified boundaries (`specs/sumeragi.md` §10). SCCP committee
  generations (§4.2) change at those key changes and also at heartbeats (same
  keys) and resyncs.
- **Taira** is the global Sumeragi instance, kind 0 index 0, with instance id
  `I = H_iroha("sumeragi/instance" ‖ genesis_hash ‖ chain_id ‖ 0x00 ‖ be32(0))`
  (`specs/sumeragi.md` §1 item 8).
- `C_h` is the scheduled committee of height `h`: `n = 3f + 1` BLS-normal keys
  with `4 ≤ n ≤ 31`, in canonical order (strictly ascending by `kb(pk)`, every
  key with the same length prefix), and `q = n − f`.
- A committee generation `g` (§4.2) is **retained** while its record exists and
  **liable** while `liable(g)` holds (§4.8). `lc(h)` is the liability clock of
  block `h` (§4.8).
- **Amounts.** Taira XOR amounts are `Numeric` values of the XOR definition
  (scale ≤ 9). `taira_units(q) = mantissa(q) × 10^(9 − scale(q))`; it MUST be
  an exact integer with `0 < taira_units(q) < 2^128`. Every destination token
  has 9 decimals, so one token unit equals one Taira unit on every chain and no
  scaling happens anywhere.

## 1. Design summary

### 1.1 Trust model

**Taira finality authorizes outbound value.** After block `h` executes, every
voter computes the 221-byte finality header `X_h`: the block's SCCP commitment
root and message count, the history accumulator, the committee generation that
certifies `h` and, at a rotation, the successor's committee root and validity.
Every voter binds it into the result it signs, `R_h = SHA-256(RESULT_TAG ‖ X_h
‖ D_body)` (§3.6). `CommitQC(h)`, exactly `q = n − f` BLS signatures of `C_h`
over `SHA-256` of the 166-byte Commit preimage, therefore certifies `X_h` with
exactly the strength of the block. A destination keeps only the current
generation `{root, generation, start, high, untilMs}`. It verifies one
aggregate signature with one pairing check (Ethereum and BSC through EIP-2537,
TON through `BLS_FASTAGGREGATEVERIFY`), verifies a keccak Merkle path to the
leaf, consumes the message nonce in an on-chain set, and mints under an
immutable supply cap before the message's deadline. Each generation's trust
deadline is fixed when the destination installs it, and only a genuine handoff
signed by the current generation installs a successor: identical, stale and
future-dated certificates never extend trust (§5.1.2). A message that is not
minted by its deadline is **voided** on the destination with the same nonce
bit, and Taira refunds it once the void is proven.

External→Taira transfers are proven natively by every Taira node against
permissionless on-chain light clients of the source chain. A proven message is
recorded and then settled, immediately or later, without re-proving. There is
no trusted setup, prover, relayer, archive, hosted service or bridge key: every
step is a permissionless transaction that a wallet builds from Taira Torii and
public RPC. Validator nodes run an in-node keeper by default that advances the
light clients, submits due keepalives and watches destinations (§4.13.4). It
adds liveness, never trust.

**Accountability.** Departed validators keep their keys. Validators of a
network with SCCP therefore stay bonded and slashable while any destination may
still trust a generation that contained them (§4.8). The unbonding delay covers
the validity window plus a grace period; a liability clock that a Taira halt
cannot consume measures it; and a destination-progress gate keeps a generation
liable until every destination network's light client has finalized past its
deadline. Any `CommitQC`-valid certificate of a generation for a Taira commit
preimage whose block or result is not Taira's at that height is slashing
evidence against every signer (`SubmitSccpForgeryEvidenceV1`, §4.9), applied
through the consensus penalty pipeline. It also holds every route revision that
may be at that generation until the Parliament attests the deployment's
progress or quarantines it (§4.10).

**The Parliament decides; destinations need no Parliament key.** Every SCCP
governance decision is taken by the SORA Parliament through
`ProposeSccpRouteGovernance` and enacted deterministically at block start
(§4.14). Binding juries use anonymous on-chain ballots
(`specs/parliament_private_ballot_design.md`); there is no Parliament key or
custodian of any kind. A pause-only fast pause track, decided by a standing
citizen panel through public account-signed endorsements, can pause a network
for a bounded time (§4.14.7). Every decision that affects a destination becomes
a control leaf of the enacting block's commitment tree, and any `CommitQC`
covering that block proves it (§4.14.6).

Safety of Taira→external rests on Taira consensus plus historical-key
accountability (§9.1). Safety of external→Taira equals each source chain's own
finality assumption plus Taira consensus. Both trust the Parliament for what it
enacts, and the fast pause panel for pauses only.

### 1.2 Settled sub-decisions

| Question | Decision | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Outbound finality | A `CommitQC` of exactly `q = n − f` signers of the destination's current generation, over a result that binds the 221-byte header `X` (§3.6–§3.8). The vote preimage, the QC and the core wire are unchanged | The proof exists when `h` commits. No second signature round, no application key family and no attestor liveness. Rejected: a new vote-preimage field (it changes every core layout and is no stronger); certifying `X_h` through the header of `h + 1` (idle chains make no `h + 1`); the commit-attestation extension (`specs/sumeragi.md` §3.7; it needs an application key family); a post-commit signing round (an attestation transport under another name) |
| Consensus signature suite | Only Sumeragi kinds `0x01`–`0x05` and RS16 availability statements sign `SHA-256(P)` of an allowlisted preimage `P` under the IETF min-pk PoP ciphersuite `DST_SIG`, through a dedicated consensus API. Every other BLS signature keeps the existing w3f transcript, and the w3f proof of possession stays the rogue-key defence (§3.8) | Destinations hash to G2 under a standard DST with audited code. A 32-byte message fits TON's message slice and fixes the EVM cost. Reserving `DST_SIG` keeps every other signing context from ever producing a vote. Unifying all BLS signatures is later work |
| Committee generations | A generation changes at a key-set change at an epoch boundary, at a heartbeat once it is `committee_heartbeat_ms` old (same keys), and at a resync after a missed boundary. Each generation has an immutable deadline anchored at its certified start (§4.2) | Deadlines that only a genuine handoff renews bound how long departed keys stay usable; heartbeats renew maintained destinations |
| Destination state | The current generation only, an `equivocated` latch, checkpoint ids and the pause state; no record of past generations (§5.1) | Constant TON state; a retired quorum cannot touch an up-to-date deployment |
| Trust model | Exit delay plus slashing: liability windows, a liability clock, a destination-progress gate, forgery evidence and per-revision holds (§4.8–§4.10) | Validators exit freely, but their stake is released only after no destination can still trust them |
| Certified time | A liveness-only executor guard withholds Prepare votes on blocks timed ahead of the local clock, and on stale blocks that apply due work; certified re-proposals are exempt. No validity rule reads a clock (§4.3; `specs/sumeragi.md` §4.5) | Bounds Byzantine-chosen block times, which anchor deadlines, without a local-clock verdict |
| Idle chains | No empty blocks. A permissionless, fee-exempt, due-gated `Keepalive` produces exactly the blocks that heartbeats and governance work need (§4.7) | Iroha produces no block without a transaction |
| Fees and permissions | Keepalives, forgery evidence, keeper light-client advances and recipient self-claims are fee-exempt only when eligible. Eligible advances and self-claims are exempt on success and charged the ordinary fee on failure; a keepalive that applies no due work or forgery evidence that fails at execution makes its block `Invalid` (K2, R-EX), so those two never fail inside a valid block. Eligibility is one predicate per kind over the committed parent state, the authority and the payload, shared by admission, fee quoting, the per-block quotas and execution, plus pre-verification and deduplication (§4.19). A transaction of an exempt shape that is not eligible pays the ordinary fee and is never refused for its shape. The only SCCP permission token is `CanProposeSccpRouteGovernance`, which only allows proposing and is granted and revoked only in genesis | A fee-exempt root is safe only when admission rejects invalid and duplicate eligible payloads before the queue; relayers, third-party settles and paid advances must stay admissible |
| Storage and pruning | Messages, control messages, inbound records, consumed sets, history leaves, per-block commitments and SCCP governance revisions are permanent. Generation records and anchor chunk roots are pruned once no longer liable (§4.11). Light-client checkpoints keep one permanent entry per stride (§4.13.1) | Old messages stay provable through the history root under any newer certificate; old burns stay provable through retained checkpoints |
| Long-range attacks, weak subjectivity | Trust deadlines anchored at certified generation starts (14 d default, 30 d immutable maximum), heartbeat renewal, and exit delay plus slashing. A destination that is not rotated in time freezes, and its in-flight value is refunded through voids (§5.1.2, §9.9) | Validators exit freely, so departed keys are bounded by time and made accountable by stake; voids make a freeze lossless |
| Old messages | Append-only **history accumulator** over SCCP-bearing blocks; every `X` carries its root, so any later certificate proves any older message (§3.5) | Destinations need only a current certificate |
| Failed transfers | Outbound: each message carries a destination-time `deadline_ms`. After it, or once the destination is frozen, anyone voids the nonce on the destination, and Taira refunds on proof of the void (§4.16, §5.1.8). Inbound: prove, then settle; a proof is recorded whenever the revision is not `Staged`, and settlement retries without a proof (§4.12). Undecodable or uncreditable recipients bounce | No value is stranded by a paused, held, retired or frozen destination, or by a temporarily unsettleable claim |
| New-user claims | Settlement registers a missing recipient account. A recipient with no XOR self-claims fee-exempt, and the fee is deducted from the proceeds (§4.12.4) | No faucet, sponsor program or hosted onboarding |
| Light-client liveness | Permissionless proof-carrying advances; the in-node keeper, enabled by default, with compiled default public RPC lists; Parliament re-initialization and trusted checkpoints as a last resort (§4.13.4) | Light clients have weak-subjectivity bounds that idle lanes would otherwise exceed. The keeper adds liveness, never trust |
| Escrow | One core-created escrow account per route, derived without the revision, created at genesis. Core rejects every non-SCCP debit, credit, registration or unregistration of it. `balance(escrow(route)) = Σ_r liability(r) + stranded(route)` (§4.15) | Registration cannot be front-run, and upgradable executor code cannot drain escrow |
| Governance | SORA Parliament only: `ProposeSccpRouteGovernance` (bonded citizen or `CanProposeSccpRouteGovernance`) → Parliament bodies with a binding jury → certificate → block-start enactment. The expected head is scoped per SCCP subject. `RegisterRoute` pins a retained committee generation; Taira recomputes the TON and EVM deployment addresses. SCCP attempts and their progress transitions are permissionless and core-derived. No route can be registered before the binding ballot and reconciliation exist (§4.14, §10.2) | Governance belongs to citizens, not to validators or keys. Per-subject heads keep independent proposals from superseding each other |
| Destination pause | Two tracks reach destinations as control leaves that carry the revision's complete pause state: track 1 (Parliament) and track 2 (fast pause). The effective pause is the Parliament pause or an unexpired fast pause; fast pauses expire on the destination by time alone. Burns, checkpoints, rotations, voids and controls are never paused (§3.4, §5.1.6) | One authority per track, no privileged key on the destination, and lapses need no relay |
| Fast pause | Pause-only. A standing panel, a disjoint backup and a reserve are drawn from the epoch-boundary beacon pulse outside the Parliament attempt reducer. Either panel decides by public, account-signed endorsements; pauses lapse automatically and can be renewed; the Parliament can lift, confirm or suspend (§4.14.7) | A brake whose latency is minutes rather than a full Parliament round, that cannot do anything but delay |
| Destination replay protection | Dense per-(network, revision) outbound nonce assigned by Taira. EVM uses a bitmap `mapping(uint256 ⇒ uint256)`; TON uses sequentially activated bucket child contracts of 512 flags that only the minter activates, once per bucket (§5.3.4) | One storage word per 256 messages. The TON account-state cap (65 536 cells) forbids an in-contract dictionary |
| Token and bridge shape | One contract per destination: an ERC-20 with the bridge built in (EVM), deployed through deterministic CREATE2; or one Jetton master with the bridge built in plus standard wallets and consumption buckets (TON). 9 decimals everywhere | No cross-contract minting, no code-hash rechecks, no unit scaling, and Taira can recompute every deployment address |
| Taira resets | Taira identity is the runtime `NetworkId`. Genesis carries a random reset nonce, so every reset has a fresh identity. Nothing Taira-specific is compiled into Rust or contracts. Old deployments freeze when their last generation's deadline passes (§4.18) | A compiled Taira identity would make every reset and devnet unusable |
| Contract toolchains | Solidity 0.8.31 (`solc` +commit.fd3a2265), legacy pipeline, `evmVersion: cancun`, for Ethereum and BSC; Acton 1.2.0 / Tolk 1.4.2 for TON. All ship native macOS arm64 binaries (§5.5) | Every contract builds natively on macOS arm64 |

## 2. Networks, identities and lanes

### 2.1 Identity words

Each profile has a 1-byte tag and a 32-byte identity word:

| Profile | `tag` | `identity_word` |
|---|---|---|
| `sora-taira` | `0x40` | the 32 bytes of Taira's `NetworkId` (hash of the genesis block header), read from world state at runtime |
| `ethereum-mainnet` | `0x41` | `word(1)` |
| `bsc-mainnet` | `0x42` | `word(56)` |
| `ton-mainnet` | `0x44` | two's-complement `int256(−239)`, i.e. `0xFF…FF11` |

`network_bytes(p) = tag(p) ‖ identity_word(p)` (33 bytes).

SCCP reads Taira's identity only from world state: no SCCP hash or check uses
the Taira `ChainId` label or a compiled Taira chain id, genesis hash or network
id. The I105 discriminant is not part of any SCCP hash. In the finality header,
`network_id` is this identity word (§3.6).

### 2.2 Lanes

A lane is a directed pair with exactly one Taira endpoint:

```
lane_bytes(source, target) = network_bytes(source) ‖ network_bytes(target)   // 66 bytes
```

Taira→X lanes carry outbound messages (minted on X). X→Taira lanes carry
inbound messages (burned on X, released on Taira).

### 2.3 Routes

One route per external profile, identified by `route_id` text:

| Profile | `route_id` | Destination token | Decimals |
|---|---|---|---|
| ETH | `taira_eth_xor` | ERC-20 bridge contract | 9 |
| BSC | `taira_bsc_xor` | BEP-20 bridge contract | 9 |
| TON | `taira_ton_xor` | Jetton master (bridge) | 9 |

Taira XOR has scale 9 (existing Taira genesis asset definition, Global policy),
so every amount in this spec is in Taira units (§0). A route has numbered
**revisions** (`u32`, from 1). Each revision binds exactly one deployed
destination contract (§4.14). `asset_id` text is `xor`.

## 3. Canonical contract-visible encodings

### 3.1 Account codecs

| Codec | Name | Bytes | Validity |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `canonical_text` | 1..=256 | printable ASCII `0x21..=0x7e`; used for `asset_id` and `route_id` only |
| 2 | `evm_address20` | 20 | nonzero |
| 3 | `taira_account` | 1..=1024 | canonical Iroha `AccountAddress` payload bytes (header ‖ controller; the I105 payload without discriminant or checksum). Contracts check only the length; Taira decodes (§4.12.3) |
| 7 | `ton_account36` | 36 | `i32` workchain (big-endian) = 0, then a nonzero 32-byte account id |

Codecs 4, 5 and 6 are unassigned; codec 5 belonged to the removed TRON profile
and every decoder rejects it. The 1024-byte bound admits Taira multisig
controllers with many members. A Taira authority whose `AccountAddress` exceeds
it cannot send (§4.4), and wallets refuse such recipients before burning
(§7.2).

### 3.2 Transfer payload

```
payload =
  u8   kind            = 0x02            // Transfer
  u8   version         = 0x01
  u32  source_domain
  u32  dest_domain
  u64  nonce
  u32  route_revision                    // nonzero
  u64  deadline_ms                       // Taira→X: destination-time mint deadline; X→Taira: 0
  u32  asset_home_domain = 0             // SORA
  u8   asset_id_codec    = 1
  u16  asset_id_len ‖ asset_id           // "xor"
  u128 amount                            // Taira units = token units, nonzero
  u8   sender_codec    ‖ u16 sender_len    ‖ sender
  u8   recipient_codec ‖ u16 recipient_len ‖ recipient
  u8   route_id_codec  = 1
  u16  route_id_len ‖ route_id           // e.g. "taira_eth_xor"
```

Rules (decoders MUST enforce all of them and MUST reject trailing bytes):

- Each variable field has the length range of its codec (§3.1). Total payload ≤
  4 096 bytes.
- `source_domain ≠ dest_domain`, exactly one of them is 0, and the other is 1,
  2 or 4.
- `deadline_ms ≠ 0` iff `source_domain = 0`. A destination mints only while
  `now_ms ≤ deadline_ms` and voids only after it (§5.1.5, §5.1.8).
- `amount ≠ 0`; `amount < 2^96` when either endpoint is TON.
- Sender and recipient codecs are determined by the domains:

| Direction | `sender_codec` | `recipient_codec` |
|---|---|---|
| Taira → ETH/BSC | 3 | 2 |
| Taira → TON | 3 | 7 |
| ETH/BSC → Taira | 2 | 3 |
| TON → Taira | 7 | 3 |

- `route_id` MUST equal the route of the external endpoint; `route_revision`
  MUST name a registered revision of that route.

Integers are big-endian and length prefixes are `u16`, so contracts parse
without byte swaps.

### 3.3 Payload hash and message id

```
payload_hash = keccak256(ASCII("SCCP/PAYLOAD/V1") ‖ payload)
message_id   = keccak256(ASCII("SCCP/MESSAGE/V1") ‖ lane_bytes(source, target) ‖ payload_hash)
```

`message_id` is the global identity of a message in both directions. It binds
the Taira network identity, so it differs across Taira resets.

### 3.4 Block commitment tree

Leaves are the **SCCP messages** recorded by one Taira block, in
`commitment_index` order (0-based execution order, dense; §4.5). An SCCP
message is either a **transfer** (an outbound payload, §3.2) or a **control**
(the complete pause state of one route revision after a Parliament or
fast-pause change, §4.14.6):

```
destination_word = word(address20)                  // EVM: the contract address
                 | ton_account_id32                 // TON: account id of the Jetton master (workchain 0)

```

**Control semantics.** A control leaf carries the **complete pause state** of
`(network, revision)` after the change, plus the authority that made it. A
destination that applies the newest leaf therefore holds both pause states
exactly, whatever was lost or reordered before it (§5.1.6).

- Track 1 (Parliament): `certificate_id = GovernanceCertificateId::derive_v1`
  of the enacted certificate, and `effect_hash` is that certificate's
  `effect_preimage_hash`.
- Track 2 (fast pause): `certificate_id =
  SccpFastPauseCertificateId::derive_v1` and `effect_hash` is that
  certificate's `effect_preimage_hash` (§4.14.7).
- Constraints, checked by Taira and by destinations (`BadControl`): `track ∈
  {1, 2}`; `parliament_paused ∈ {0, 1}`; `track = 2 ⇒ fast_pause_until_ms ≠ 0`;
  `certificate_id ≠ 0`; `effect_hash ≠ 0`.
- There is no lapse leaf: destinations expire a fast pause from the
  authenticated `fast_pause_until_ms` by their own clock.

The preimages differ in prefix and length (transfer 76 bytes, node 76 bytes
with a different prefix, control 199 bytes), and verifiers always compute the
leaf they check from its fields, so no leaf kind can pass as another or as an
internal node. `leaf` without qualification means either kind.

On TON, 199 bytes exceed one cell, so the contract hashes two byte-aligned
builders with `HASHEXT` id 3: `b1` = tag ‖ lane ‖ destination word ‖ revision ‖
nonce (125 bytes) and `b2` = track ‖ `parliament_paused` ‖
`fast_pause_until_ms` ‖ `certificate_id` ‖ `effect_hash` (74 bytes).

Example control leaves (pinned in `fixtures/sccp/control_v1.json`, §11), for
Taira `NetworkId = 0x11…11` (32 bytes of `0x11`), target `ethereum-mainnet`,
`destination_word = 0x00…00 ‖ 20 bytes of 0x22`, `route_revision = 1`:

| nonce | track | `parliament_paused` | `fast_pause_until_ms` | `certificate_id` | `effect_hash` | leaf |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | `0x33^32` | `0x44^32` | `0xd9be284f6412d8e310b35afa921f8244f8d56cc64fbfc795d58701c11dce4d77` |
| 2 | 2 | 0 | 1 700 604 800 000 | `0x55^32` | `0x66^32` | `0xfbdf5c5743292897ecf43c3d74fe0a3d3946aa73219bdab2f0a3e33bc0b988e0` |
| 3 | 1 | 1 | 1 700 604 800 000 | `0x77^32` | `0x88^32` | `0x8afcebc533342cb86836b0195edc6a55e8e998d8e52d85f1fbf2c2707193c518` |
| 4 | 1 | 0 | 0 | `0x99^32` | `0xaa^32` | `0xb52aafb5bd2fcc77db32e1dfb8a92890b97adc2b9e81dd30f63dba3c059c8df3` |

The preimage of nonce 2 is `534343502f434f4e54524f4c2f5631 40 11…11 41 00…01
00…00 22…22 00000001 0000000000000002 02 00 0000018bf3f1ec00 55…55 66…66`.

Tree rule ("promote-odd"): level 0 is the leaf list. Each next level pairs
elements left to right, and an unpaired last element is promoted unchanged. The
root of a single-leaf tree is that leaf. A block has 1..=512 leaves of both
kinds together (`SCCP_MESSAGES_MAX_PER_BLOCK_V1`), so paths have at most 9
siblings.

Verification is positional and binds the leaf index and count:

```
fn merkle_root(leaf, index, count, siblings) -> bytes32:
    require count ≥ 1 and index < count
    h, k = leaf, 0
    while count > 1:
        if index is odd:              h = node(siblings[k], h); k += 1
        elif index + 1 < count:       h = node(h, siblings[k]); k += 1
        # else: promoted, no sibling at this level
        index = index >> 1
        count = (count + 1) >> 1
    require k == len(siblings)
    return h
```

### 3.5 History accumulator

Taira keeps an append-only list of every SCCP-bearing block (message count > 0,
counting transfer and control leaves), in height order:

```
history_leaf(height, sccp_root, message_count) =
    keccak256(ASCII("SCCP/HISTORY/V1") ‖ u64 height ‖ sccp_root ‖ u32 message_count)
history_root(size) = promote-odd root (§3.4 node rule) over the first `size` history leaves
```

`history_root(0) = 0x00…00`. The promote-odd tree equals a right-bagged Merkle
mountain range: with the perfect-subtree roots `P_a, P_b, …, P_z` of the binary
decomposition of `size` (largest first), `root = node(P_a, node(P_b, …
node(P_y, P_z)))`. Taira therefore maintains it in O(log size) state (the
peaks), and verifiers use the same `merkle_root` function with `(leaf_index,
history_size)`. History paths have at most 32 siblings (`history_size ≤ 2^32`
is enforced). Every active finality header carries the accumulator after its
block (§3.6), so a certificate of any later block proves any older message
(§5.1.5).

### 3.6 Finality header `X` and the certified result `R`

**Layout.** `X` (`SccpFinalityHeaderV1`) is exactly 221 bytes:

| Offset | Size | Field | Encoding |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 16 | `magic` | `ASCII("SCCP/FINALITY/V1")` |
| 16 | 32 | `network_id` | the instance's genesis-derived `NetworkId` (for Taira, the §2.1 identity word) |
| 48 | 8 | `height` | `u64 h` |
| 56 | 8 | `timestamp_ms` | `u64 t(h)` |
| 64 | 1 | `flags` | bit 0 `ACTIVE`, bit 1 `ROTATION`, bits 2–7 zero |
| 65 | 4 | `message_count` | `u32` |
| 69 | 32 | `sccp_root` | bytes32 |
| 101 | 8 | `history_size` | `u64` |
| 109 | 32 | `history_root` | bytes32 |
| 141 | 8 | `generation` | `u64`: the generation that certifies `h` (§4.2 G5) |
| 149 | 32 | `committee_root` | `committee_root(C_h)` (§3.7) |
| 181 | 8 | `validity_ms` | `u64`: with `ROTATION`, the validity granted to the successor generation; otherwise 0 |
| 189 | 32 | `next_committee_root` | with `ROTATION`, `committee_root(C_{h+1})` (equal to `committee_root` at a heartbeat); otherwise zero |

TON splits `X` at offset 109: `XHead = X[0..109)` (872 bits) and `XTail =
X[109..221)` (896 bits).

**When `ACTIVE` is set.** `ACTIVE` is set iff SCCP exists (`sccp_parameters` is
present), the executing instance is Taira (global kind 0, index 0), and the
authenticated inputs of `h` are present and consistent (§4.2 G4, G7). With
`ACTIVE`:

- `message_count` and `sccp_root` are the `sccp_block_commitments[h]` entry, or
  0 and zero when there is none;
- `history_size` and `history_root` describe the accumulator after `h`,
  including `h`'s own leaf;
- `ROTATION` is set iff rule G2 ends the current generation at `h`, at a key
  change or at a heartbeat. A resync (G7) never sets it.

**Invariants.** Every producer and every parser MUST enforce X1–X7 through one
function, `SccpFinalityHeaderV1::parse`:

| # | Invariant |
|---|---|
| X1 | `magic` is exact, and `flags & 0xFC = 0` |
| X2 | `ACTIVE` unset ⇒ bytes `[65..221)` are zero and `ROTATION` is unset |
| X3 | `ACTIVE` set ⇒ `generation ≥ 1` and `committee_root ≠ 0` |
| X4 | `message_count = 0 ⇔ sccp_root = 0`, and `message_count ≤ 512` |
| X5 | `history_size = 0 ⇔ history_root = 0`, and `history_size ≤ 2^32` |
| X6 | `ROTATION` set ⇒ `next_committee_root ≠ 0` and `1 ≤ validity_ms ≤ MAX_VALIDITY_MS`. `ROTATION` unset ⇒ `next_committee_root = 0` and `validity_ms = 0`. `next_committee_root = committee_root` is allowed (heartbeat) |
| X7 | `height ≥ 1` |

**Inactive form.** `X = magic ‖ network_id ‖ be64(h) ‖ be64(t(h)) ‖ 0x00 ‖
0^156`. It is used by every non-global root that uses
`ExecutionResultCommitment` (dataspace roots, private developer anchors), by
Taira before SCCP is initialized, and by Taira blocks whose inputs are missing
(§4.6). Lane instances keep their own `LANE_RESULT_TAG` result and carry no
`X`. Destinations reject an inactive `X`.

**Certified result.** For every instance that uses `ExecutionResultCommitment`:

```
body   = norito::encode_canonical(ExecutionResultCommitment)     // ≤ MAX_RESULT_BODY_BYTES = 65 315
D_body = H_iroha(RESULT_BODY_TAG ‖ body)                           // 32 bytes, opaque to destinations
R      = SHA-256(RESULT_TAG ‖ X ‖ D_body)                          // 277-byte input, raw 32 bytes
```

- `RESULT_TAG = ASCII("iroha/sumeragi/result/v1")` (24 bytes) and
  `RESULT_BODY_TAG = ASCII("iroha/sumeragi/result-body/v1")` (29 bytes).
- `R` is not an `H_iroha` value: code MUST NOT pass it through
  `Hash::prehashed`, `HashOf` or any type that checks or sets the marker bit.
- The stored result preimage (`CommitCertificate.result_preimage` and the
  flagged-QC `ResultWitness`) is `X ‖ body`, at most `MAX_RESULT_PREIMAGE_BYTES
  = 65 536` bytes in total, which equals the core's unchanged
  `MAX_RESULT_WITNESS_BYTES` (`specs/sumeragi.md` §3.6, §4.1.1).
- `result_of_preimage(p)` is the only `R` function, for voters and readers
  alike. It returns nothing if `len(p) < 222`, if `len(p) > 65 536`, or if
  `SccpFinalityHeaderV1::parse(p[0..221])` fails; otherwise it returns
  `SHA-256(RESULT_TAG ‖ p[0..221] ‖ H_iroha(RESULT_BODY_TAG ‖ p[221..]))`.
  Callers MUST treat nothing as a mismatch, never as a local fault.
- SHA-256 is native on TON (`HASHEXT` id 0) and on EVM (precompile `0x02`), and
  it is already inside the BLS suite.

**Readers.** Every Rust reader that holds `X ‖ body` without executing it MUST
decode it through `CertifiedResultV1::decode(p, scope)`, with `scope ∈
{TairaGlobal, NonGlobal}`, and MUST check:

- **C1.** X1–X7 hold, and `X.height = body.height`.
- **C2.** `X.network_id` equals the network of the epoch context that the
  certified schedule assigns to `X.height`.
- **C3.** With `ACTIVE`: `X.committee_root` equals the `committee_root` of that
  context's committee keys.
- **C4.** With `ACTIVE`: if the body carries a boundary decision whose
  successor committee root differs from `X.committee_root`, then `ROTATION` is
  set and `X.next_committee_root` equals that root; if `ROTATION` is set with
  `X.next_committee_root ≠ X.committee_root`, the body MUST carry that boundary
  decision.
- **C5.** When the reader holds the block: `X.timestamp_ms = t(X.height)` and
  `X.height` equals the block height.
- **Scope.** `NonGlobal` requires `ACTIVE` unset.

The SCCP fields (`sccp_root`, `message_count`, `history_*`, `generation`,
`validity_ms` and heartbeat rotations) cannot be derived from the body. Their
only authority is the quorum signature, and Taira's forgery evidence (§4.9)
holds signers to them.

### 3.7 Committee root and certificate encodings

**Committee root.**

```
committee_root(C) = keccak256(ASCII("SCCP/COMMITTEE/V1") ‖ u8 n ‖ PK_0 ‖ … ‖ PK_{n−1})   // 18 + 48n bytes
```

Keys are compressed and in canonical order, and bitmap index `i` is `PK_i`.
Compressed keys suit TON's BLS opcodes, and EVM takes each signer's `y` from
calldata, which avoids a square root per key. Example (synthetic, not points):
keys `0x01^48, 0x02^48, 0x03^48, 0x04^48` give
`0xfe8902a93a6592a748b8528a9f49312e9cbc5d1abcccb1ff7431b0acba92b2b9`.

**`QC_FIXED` (117 bytes)** carries the fields of a `CommitQC` that a
destination needs:

| Offset | Size | Field | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 8 | `epoch` | `qc.epoch.epoch` |
| 8 | 32 | `epoch_context` | `qc.epoch.context` |
| 40 | 8 | `view` | `qc.view` |
| 48 | 32 | `block_hash` | `qc.block_hash` (the Sumeragi core block hash) |
| 80 | 1 | `attest` | `u8(qc.attest)` |
| 81 | 32 | `result_body` | `D_body` |
| 113 | 4 | `signers` | `be32(Σ_j bitmap[j] << 8j)` |

`signers` is derived from the Sumeragi bitmap, in which bit `i` is canonical
index `i`, LSB-first within each byte. Example: `n = 31`, indices {0, 9, 30}:
bitmap bytes `01 02 00 40`, `signers = 0x40000201`, encoded `40 00 02 01`.
Copying the bitmap bytes raw would give `0x01020040`, which is wrong (a
negative vector).

**Commit preimage and message.**

```
P = ASCII("sumeragi/sig") ‖ 0x03 ‖ I ‖ be64(epoch) ‖ epoch_context ‖ be64(X.height) ‖ be64(view)
    ‖ block_hash ‖ R ‖ attest                                    // 166 bytes (specs/sumeragi.md §3.3)
m = SHA-256(P)
checkpoint_id(X) = keccak256(X)
```

**Signatures and committee on the wire.** The aggregate signature is the
96-byte compressed `qc.agg_sig` (TON, Taira) or its 192-byte EIP-2537 form
`x.c0 ‖ x.c1 ‖ y.c0 ‖ y.c1` (EVM; ZCash compression stores `c1` first). On EVM
the committee is supplied as `48n` bytes of compressed keys and `signerYs`,
`48q` bytes holding each signer's `y` in ascending index order; TON reads the
keys from storage.

### 3.8 Consensus signatures and the destination verification relation

**Suite.** Sumeragi signatures of kinds `0x01`–`0x05` and the RS16 availability
statements sign `m = SHA-256(P)` for an allowlisted preimage `P` only, as `σ =
sk · hash_to_G2(m, DST_SIG)` with `DST_SIG =
ASCII("BLS_SIG_BLS12381G2_XMD:SHA-256_SSWU_RO_POP_")` (43 bytes), the IETF
min-pk proof-of-possession ciphersuite. The allowlist, the consensus API and
the registry of every other BLS signing context are normative in
`specs/sumeragi.md` §1 item 6. Every other BLS signature, including the
consensus-key proof of possession, keeps the existing w3f transcript (`TODO:`
unify every BLS signature on RFC 9380 suites in a later release). Only the
consensus API ever hashes under `DST_SIG`, so no signature obtained in another
context (Torii's chosen-challenge node attestation, P2P relay digests,
lifecycle certificates) can verify as a vote or a `CommitQC` share. Kind `0x06`
(`att_preimage`) is not signed with consensus keys and is not allowlisted.

**Signing relation** (the Rust reference equals the destination relation):

- `KeyValidate(PK)`: the encoding is canonical, not the identity, and in the
  subgroup. It is an admission invariant on Taira; TON's aggregate opcode check
  does not replace it.
- `FastAggregateVerify(PK_1..k, m, σ)`: `k ≥ 1`; every key is w3f-PoP-admitted
  or comes from an authenticated committee root; `apk = Σ PK_i ≠ O`; `σ` is
  canonical, in the subgroup and not O; `e(apk, H(m)) = e(g1, σ)`.

**Destination verification relation** (normative; Taira's forgery evidence uses
it too, §4.9). Inputs: `QC_FIXED`, `X`, `σ` and the keys `PK_0..PK_{n−1}` of
the current generation.

1. `n ∈ {4, 7, …, 31}`, `f = (n − 1)/3`, `q = n − f`.
2. `signers >> n = 0` and `popcount(signers) = q` exactly.
3. `attest ∈ {0, 1}`; no other constraint applies (a boundary block need not be
   flagged, `specs/sumeragi.md` §3.7 A1, and a heartbeat is an ordinary block).
4. `R = SHA-256(RESULT_TAG ‖ X ‖ result_body)`.
5. `P` per §3.7 with the pinned `I`; `epoch`, `epoch_context`, `view` and
   `block_hash` come unverified from `QC_FIXED`. Kind `0x03` is mandatory: a
   PrepareQC is never accepted.
6. `m = SHA-256(P)`.
7. `apk = Σ_{bit i set} PK_i ≠ O`.
8. `Q = hash_to_curve_G2(m, DST_SIG)` per RFC 9380: `expand_message_xmd(m,
   DST_SIG, 256)` with `Z_pad = 0^64`, `l_i_b_str = 0x0100` and `DST_prime =
   DST_SIG ‖ 0x2b`; `u0 = (OS2IP(b[0..64]) mod p, OS2IP(b[64..128]) mod p)`,
   `u1 = (OS2IP(b[128..192]) mod p, OS2IP(b[192..256]) mod p)`; `Q = map(u0) +
   map(u1)` with `map` = EIP-2537 `MAP_FP2_TO_G2` (which includes cofactor
   clearing).
9. Accept iff `σ` is in G2's subgroup, `σ ≠ O`, and `e(apk, Q) · e(−g1, σ) =
   1`.

**Rogue keys and root admission.** The w3f proof of possession with
`KeyValidate` makes `FastAggregateVerify` rogue-key secure for every key Taira
admits; its hash domain differs from `DST_SIG`, so a proof of possession is
never a consensus signature and the reverse. A destination root enters in only
two ways: the Parliament-pinned generation, whose keys Taira validated (§4.14.3
P1), or `X.next_committee_root` of a rotation certified by the current
generation, whose `f + 1` honest signers computed it from a validated successor
context or from the unchanged keys at a heartbeat. Taira's strict key ordering
excludes duplicates; TON re-checks ordering when it installs keys. The residual
risk, a generation signing a forged rotation while a destination still trusts
it, is the slashable case of §4.9.

**Frozen external verification surface.** The Commit preimage layout, the `I`
derivation, LSB-first bitmap order, `n ≤ 31`, `q = n − f`, the
`DST_SIG`-plus-SHA-256 rule, `RESULT_TAG` and the `X` layout are pinned by
`specs/sumeragi.md` §3.3.1 and its golden test. Changing any of them requires a
new route revision with new contracts, activated by the Parliament (§4.14.3),
not only a node release.

Implementations MUST pin all constants in golden tests (§11). Every selector

over the canonical signature strings, with tuple types expanded as the Solidity
ABI does; the same implementation reproduces the unchanged
`SccpTransferToTaira` topic.

## 4. Taira side

### 4.1 On-chain parameters and activation

SCCP consensus parameters are one Taira-internal value `SccpParametersV1`. It
lives in dedicated world state (`sccp_parameters`), not in the generic
`Parameter` set. It is written only by the genesis-only instruction
`InitializeSccpV1` and by the Parliament-enacted action `SetParameters`
(§4.14.3), so no executor upgrade, no `SetParameter` path and no validator can
alter it.

```
InitializeSccpV1 {
    parameters: SccpParametersV1,
    reset_nonce: [u8; 32],      // fresh randomness per Taira genesis, nonzero (§4.18)
}
```

`InitializeSccpV1` is valid only inside the genesis block, and only under NPoS
consensus parameters whose committees satisfy `n = 3f + 1`, `4 ≤ n ≤ 31`. It
checks every rule of the table below, the epoch-duration guard (§4.2) and the
staking floor L1 against the genesis-pinned staking policy (§4.8), so a genesis
that fails any of them is invalid. It stores the parameters, creates the three
route escrow accounts (§4.15), an empty registry and committee generation 1
(§4.2 G1), and **no route**: routes are registered only by the Parliament after
the launch gate opens (§10.2). SCCP exists on a network iff `sccp_parameters`
is present; no compiled chain id gates it.

| Field | Default (Taira genesis value) | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | `true` | When false, only value-moving effects stop: `RecordSccpMessage` fails, and inbound settlement and outbound refunds stay `Pending`. Generations, finality headers, anchors, keepalives, forgery evidence, light-client advances, inbound and void proof recording, Parliament enactment, fast pauses and control messages keep running, so re-enabling needs no recovery and destinations keep receiving rotations and controls. Per-route stops use `Paused` (§4.14.2) |
| `committee_validity_ms` | 1 209 600 000 (14 d) | `fast_pause_hold_ms + 2·committee_heartbeat_ms + 86 400 000 ≤ v ≤ MAX_VALIDITY_MS`, and `v + forgery_evidence_grace_ms ≤ unbonding_delay_ms` of the pinned staking policy (§4.8 L1) |
| `committee_heartbeat_ms` | 86 400 000 (1 d) | `≥ SCCP_MIN_HEARTBEAT_MS` (1 h) |
| `forgery_evidence_grace_ms` | 604 800 000 (7 d) | `86 400 000 ..= 2 592 000 000` |
| `destination_progress_cap_ms` | 2 592 000 000 (30 d) | `0 ..= 2 592 000 000` (§4.8 L5) |
| `outbound_ttl_ms` | 604 800 000 (7 d) | 1 d..=90 d; `deadline_ms = creation_time_ms(record block) + outbound_ttl_ms` |
| `min_outbound_amount` | 10^9 (1 XOR) | Floor per outbound message; bounds permanent dust records. `1 ≤ min_outbound_amount ≤ 10^15` (1 000 000 XOR) |
| `inbound_self_claim_fee` | 10^7 (0.01 XOR) | Deducted from the proceeds of a fee-exempt self-claim (§4.12.4). `inbound_self_claim_fee ≤ 10^10` (10 XOR) |
| `max_exempt_transactions_per_block` | 32 | `8..=1 024`, and at least the sum of the fixed per-class quotas of §4.19 plus 1 (those quotas sum to 5, so every allowed value leaves room for self-claims) |
| `fast_pause_panel_seats` | 9 | `∈ {5, 7, 9}`; quorum `parliament_quorum_seats_v1`: 4, 5 and 6. The draw also takes up to `k` reserve members (§4.14.7) |
| `fast_pause_panel_term_ms` | 604 800 000 (7 d) | `≥ SCCP_MIN_EPOCH_MS`. A value equal to the epoch duration draws at every epoch boundary. The 7 d default awaits owner confirmation (§13 item 1) |
| `fast_pause_seat_accept_window_ms` | 43 200 000 (12 h) | `600 000 ..= fast_pause_panel_term_ms / 2` |
| `fast_pause_endorse_window_ms` | 1 800 000 (30 min) | `300 000 ..= 21 600 000` |
| `fast_pause_renew_lead_ms` | 86 400 000 (1 d) | `2·fast_pause_endorse_window_ms ..= fast_pause_hold_ms / 2` |
| `fast_pause_hold_ms` | 864 000 000 (10 d) | `≥ parliament_sccp_attempt_latency_ms()` and `≤ MAX_FAST_PAUSE_MS − 86 400 000` |

`InitializeSccpV1` and `SetParameters` check every rule, including the joint
ones, against the complete new value. The defaults satisfy every rule: the
validity rule gives 10 d + 2·1 d + 1 d = 13 d ≤ 14 d, and the unbonding rule
gives 14 d + 7 d = 21 d, which the SCCP staking profile meets (§4.8 L1).
Windows are in milliseconds of Taira block time, not in blocks, because Iroha
produces no empty blocks and block counts have no wall-clock bound.

- **Who changes the parameters.** After genesis only the Parliament's SCCP
  action `SetParameters` writes `SccpParametersV1`, and that action is refused
  while the launch gate is closed (§10.2): until the Parliament's binding
  ballot exists, the genesis values hold and there is no interim governance.
  Core rejects every generic `SetParameter` that targets SCCP state, whatever
  the executor.
- **Parliament coupling.** `parliament_sccp_attempt_latency_ms()` is provided
  by the Parliament pipeline (§10.1; ballot spec §11): the latency of one
  full-track SCCP attempt, including a single sortition-retry generation,
  derived from the committed windows. The ballot has no ballot retries, so the
  hold covers one attempt; a longer outage, such as a rejected attempt followed
  by a retry attempt, is covered by renewing the fast pause before it lapses,
  which has no cooldown (§4.14.7). The Parliament's own parameter path MUST
  re-check the `fast_pause_hold_ms` rule whenever a window that the function
  derives from changes. `TODO:` pin `fast_pause_hold_ms` once the post-quantum
  ballot's windows are fixed; if one attempt takes more than about 27 d, SCCP
  cannot be configured and the ballot timings must change.
- **Related chain parameters.** The Sumeragi parameter `max_clock_drift_ms`
  (default 1 000) is capped at `MAX_CLOCK_DRIFT_BOUND_MS` (60 000) by genesis
  validation and by `validate_parameter_change`; the governance parameter
  `gov.due_work_max_lag_ms` (default 60 000) MUST be at least
  `2·max_clock_drift_ms + 4·block_cadence_ms` (§4.3). The staking floor
  (`nexus.staking.unbonding_delay_ms`, `nexus.staking.max_slash_bps`) is node
  configuration pinned by the genesis Nexus consensus-policy digest (§4.8 L1).
- **Deleted fields.** `roster_max_age_ms` and `roster_validity_ms` are replaced
  by `committee_heartbeat_ms` and `committee_validity_ms`;
  `attestation_retention_ms`, `attestation_stall_ms` and
  `max_attestation_entries_per_instruction` are deleted with the attestation
  transport.

Node-local behavior (keeper key directory, keepalive stagger, watch and
light-client endpoints) lives in `iroha_config` `[sccp.keeper]` and
`[sccp.light_client_keeper]` (§4.13.4), with defaults that need no operator
input. The `[zk.sccp]` native verifier work limits stay in `iroha_config` and
remain bound into the consensus policy hash. Each category has a
per-transaction and a per-block limit: proofs, proof bytes (plus a per-frame
bound), native headers and header bytes, Ethereum light-client updates, BSC
vote attestations and Ed25519 signature checks (TON). Defaults admit one full
advance of every chain in a transaction and four in a block.

### 4.2 Committee generations and consensus anchors

A **committee generation** is the unit of destination trust. It names a
committee key set (§3.7) and an immutable trust deadline.

#### 4.2.1 State

```
sccp_committee_generations: u64 → SccpCommitteeGenerationV1 {
    generation: u64,
    committee_root: [u8; 32],
    keys: Vec<[u8; 48]>,                              // canonical order; bitmap index i = keys[i]
    members: Vec<Option<SccpGenerationMemberV1>>,     // same order: { lane_id, validator: AccountId, activation_height: u64 } (G6)
    cause: SccpGenerationCauseV1,                      // Genesis | KeyChange | Heartbeat | Resync
    start_height: u64,
    start_timestamp_ms: u64,                           // t of the handoff block (Genesis: t(genesis); Resync: t(h))
    start_lc: u64,                                     // lc of the same block (§4.8)
    validity_ms: u64,                                  // committee_validity_ms in effect at creation
    deadline_ms: u64,                                  // start_timestamp_ms + validity_ms (destination-facing)
    grace_ms: u64,                                     // forgery_evidence_grace_ms in effect at creation
    progress_cap_ms: u64,                              // destination_progress_cap_ms in effect at creation
    liable_until_lc: u64,                              // start_lc + validity_ms + grace_ms
    dest_cleared_lc: Option<u64>,                      // §4.8 L5
    end: Option<SccpGenerationEndV1 {
        end_height: u64, end_timestamp_ms: u64,
        next_committee_root: [u8; 32], successor_validity_ms: u64 }>,
}
sccp_committee_current: u64
sccp_liability_clock: u64                              // lc of the latest block (§4.8)
sccp_degraded_run: u32                                 // consecutive degraded blocks ending at the tip (§4.6)
sccp_anchor_open: Vec<SccpAnchorV1 { core_hash: [u8; 32], result: [u8; 32] }>   // anchors of the open chunk, by position
sccp_anchor_chunks: u64 (chunk index) → [u8; 32]       // Merkle roots of completed chunks
```

**Consensus anchors.** The anchor of height `a` is `(core_hash_a, R_a)`: the
Sumeragi core block hash (`header.hash` over the core `BlockHeader`; for
genesis the core hash of the genesis block) and the certified result. This is
what a `CommitQC` signs as `block_hash` and `R`. It is not Iroha's
`HashOf<BlockHeader>` in `state.block_hashes`. The native execution tip holds
exactly `(core_hash, result)` for the latest applied block, authenticated
against its commit certificate.

- **Recording.** Rule A1 appends the anchor of `h − 1` in the post-execution
  hook of block `h`, reading it from the parent's native execution tip, which
  is still the parent's at that point. Appending at the end of the block means
  that every lookup during block `h` sees exactly the parent state's anchors,
  so admission against the committed tip sees the same anchors as execution,
  even when the append completes a chunk.
- **Chunks.** Height `a` has chunk `c = ⌊(a − 1) / 4 096⌋` and position `p = (a
  − 1) mod 4 096`. When position 4 095 is appended, Core computes the chunk
  root, a complete binary Merkle tree over `anchor_leaf(a) =
  H_iroha("sccp/anchor-leaf/v1" ‖ be64(a) ‖ core_hash ‖ R)` with nodes
  `H_iroha("sccp/anchor-node/v1" ‖ left ‖ right)`, stores it in
  `sccp_anchor_chunks[c]` and clears `sccp_anchor_open`. The open chunk holds
  at most 4 096 × 64 B = 256 KiB.
- **Lookup.** `anchor(a)` during the execution of block `h_exec` (or at
  admission against the tip `h_exec − 1`) reads the parent state: for `a =
  h_exec − 1` it is the parent's native execution tip record; for `a` in the
  parent's open chunk it is `sccp_anchor_open[(a − 1) mod 4 096]`; otherwise it
  needs a witness `{core_hash, result, path}` that hashes to
  `sccp_anchor_chunks[c]` through its 12-hash bottom-up path with leaf index
  `(a − 1) mod 4 096`. If that root was pruned, the lookup fails with
  `EvidenceExpired` (§4.9).
- Anchors are recorded for every height while SCCP exists, whatever `X` was; A1
  needs no SCCP inputs and runs in degraded blocks too.
- **Why chunks.** A per-height map over the retained window would hold about
  116 MB at a 1 s cadence with the defaults (64 B × 86 400 × 21 d). Chunk roots
  cost 32 B per 4 096 heights, and completed chunks never change, so a witness
  never goes stale.

#### 4.2.2 Rules

The rules use the authenticated height inputs (`SccpHeightInputsV1` from the
Sumeragi core's lag-2 `consensus_schedule` in world state; its committee fields
are key lists), never Kura or a parent finality artifact. S0 runs at block
start; G2–G7 and A1 run in the post-execution hook (§4.5).

| # | Rule |
|---|---|
| S0 | **Begin-block step** (`sccp::hook::begin_block`). It runs before the governance block-start pass (§4.7) and before any transaction, sets `lc(h)` (§4.8) and never fails the block. |
| A1 | **Anchor append.** Append the anchor of `h − 1` from the parent's native execution tip and close the chunk when it is full. It runs in every block while SCCP exists. |
| G1 | **Genesis.** `InitializeSccpV1` creates generation 1 with the keys of `C_genesis`, `cause = Genesis`, `start_height` = the genesis height, `start_timestamp_ms = start_lc = t(genesis)`, and `validity_ms`, `deadline_ms`, `grace_ms`, `progress_cap_ms` and `liable_until_lc` from the initial parameters. |
| G2 | **Generation change at `h`.** Let `KEY := h is the last height of its epoch ∧ committee_root(C_{h+1}) ≠ current.committee_root` and `BEAT := t(h) ≥ current.start_timestamp_ms + committee_heartbeat_ms`. If G4 passes and `KEY ∨ BEAT`: (1) set `current.end = {h, t(h), committee_root(C_{h+1}), committee_validity_ms}`; (2) insert `g + 1` with `keys(C_{h+1})`, members (G6), `cause = KeyChange` if `KEY` else `Heartbeat`, `start_height = h + 1`, `start_timestamp_ms = t(h)`, `start_lc = lc(h)`, `validity_ms = committee_validity_ms`, `deadline_ms = t(h) + validity_ms`, the current `grace_ms` and `progress_cap_ms`, `liable_until_lc = lc(h) + validity_ms + grace_ms` and `dest_cleared_lc = None`; (3) set `sccp_committee_current = g + 1`; (4) emit `SccpCommitteeGenerationCreated { generation, cause, committee_root, start_height, deadline_ms }`. At a non-boundary height `C_{h+1} = C_h`, so a heartbeat keeps the keys. |
| G3 | **No other trigger** besides G7: no forced rotation, no fault rotation and no inertness. |
| G4 | **Inputs (fail-closed in SCCP only).** Every block checks that the authenticated inputs of `h` are present. On failure, §4.6 applies: inactive `X`, `sccp_degraded_run` incremented, an event, and no G2 or G7. Otherwise `sccp_degraded_run` is reset to 0. It is never `Invalid`. |
| G5 | **`X` fields.** `X.generation` is the generation current before G2 runs at `h`, after any G7 at `h`; at a rotation that is the outgoing generation. `X.committee_root = committee_root(C_h)` from the authenticated inputs. `ROTATION` is set iff G2 fired at `h`; then `X.next_committee_root = committee_root(C_{h+1})` and `X.validity_ms = (g + 1).validity_ms`, otherwise both are zero. |
| G6 | **Member resolution.** For each key of a new generation, Core resolves the NPoS validator record bound to that consensus key at `h`: `(lane_id, validator, activation_height)`, through the same peer-key lookup the penalty pipeline uses. The stored binding, not a later lookup, is what liability and penalties use (§4.9). A key cannot be rebound after activation. An unresolvable key is stored as `None` and emits `SccpGenerationMemberUnslashable { generation, index }`; under NPoS every elected member has a record, so `None` signals a misconfiguration. `TODO:` assert in genesis validation that every genesis peer has a staking record. |
| G7 | **Resync.** It applies when G4 passes but `committee_root(current) ≠ committee_root(C_h)`, which happens only when a key change was missed at a degraded boundary. Before G5: (1) set `current.end = {h − 1, t(h − 1), committee_root(C_h), committee_validity_ms}`, taking `t(h − 1)` from the parent tip; (2) insert `g + 1` with `keys(C_h)`, members (G6), `cause = Resync`, `start_height = h`, `start_timestamp_ms = t(h)`, `start_lc = lc(h)` and the other fields as in G2; (3) set the current generation; (4) emit `SccpCommitteeResync { generation, committee_root, start_height }`. `X_h` is then certified by `g + 1`, and G2 runs normally afterwards. No certificate of `g` names `g + 1`, so destinations still at `g` freeze at `deadline_ms(g)` and new deployments pin `g + 1` or later. |

**Rate.** G2 fires at most once per block. `KEY` needs an epoch boundary, and
boundaries are at least `SCCP_MIN_EPOCH_MS` apart (below); `BEAT` needs
`committee_heartbeat_ms ≥ 1 h` since the last start of any cause. A heartbeat
can fire just before a key-change boundary, so `KEY` and `BEAT` can fire on
consecutive blocks. At the 1 h minima of both that gives at most 48 rotations a
day; with the defaults (1 h epochs, 1 d heartbeat) at most 24 key changes and
one heartbeat a day, because a key change resets the heartbeat timer. A resync
needs a bug (§4.6).

**Idle chains.** `BEAT` needs a block at or after the heartbeat time, and the
keepalive is due exactly then (§4.7), so an idle Taira produces one block per
`committee_heartbeat_ms` and no other SCCP block.

**Epoch-duration guard.** While SCCP exists, `epoch_length_blocks ×
block_cadence_ms ≥ SCCP_MIN_EPOCH_MS` MUST hold. `InitializeSccpV1` and
`validate_parameter_change` for `EpochLengthBlocks` check it. Canonical time
advances by at least the cadence per block, so key changes happen at most 24
times a day, and each change and each heartbeat costs every destination one
rotation (§5.4).

#### 4.2.3 Trust deadlines on destinations

- A destination installs generation `g + 1` from a rotation certificate `X_B`
  signed by `g`, with `untilMs = min(X_B.timestamp_ms, now_ms) +
  X_B.validity_ms`. Because `X_B.timestamp_ms = start_timestamp_ms(g + 1)` and
  `X_B.validity_ms = validity_ms(g + 1)`, this is at most `deadline_ms(g + 1)`.
  For the pinned generation, `untilMs = deadline_ms(g)` (§4.14.3 P1).
- No destination therefore accepts any certificate of `g` after
  `deadline_ms(g)` by its own clock, whatever is submitted in whatever order.
  No certificate other than a genuine handoff (a rotation certificate of the
  current generation) ever renews trust.
- "By its own clock" matters: a destination's block time can lag real time
  after a destination halt, so Taira's liability waits for authenticated
  destination progress (§4.8 L5).
- A generation lives about `committee_heartbeat_ms` plus the keepalive latency,
  so a maintained destination has about `committee_validity_ms −
  committee_heartbeat_ms` (13 d with the defaults) to apply each rotation.
- Lowering `committee_validity_ms` shortens only the deadlines of later
  generations, so a successor can expire before its predecessor. A destination
  that lags by more than the new value freezes. Value drains through voids, so
  this is safe, but it should be announced; pins check every generation on the
  catch-up path (§4.14.3 P2).

### 4.3 Certified time

Canonical block time is `max(parent + cadence, lane time floor, max
tx.creation_time + 1)`, and only genesis is checked against a wall clock. One
Byzantine leader could therefore move Taira's clock arbitrarily far forward
with a post-dated transaction, or include an old due transaction and anchor due
work at a stale time. SCCP and the governance clock anchor deadlines at
certified block times (generation starts, fast-pause expiries, Parliament
anchors), so both directions need a bound. The rules are application-level
executor rules, specified normatively in `specs/sumeragi.md` §4.5; no validity
rule depends on a clock:

| # | Rule (summary) |
|---|---|
| CT1 | **Clock ahead.** For every non-genesis block of every Sumeragi instance of the network executed with `certified = false`, the executor answers `Failed(ClockAhead)`, never `Invalid`, while `t(block) > local_wall_ms + max_clock_drift_ms`. No `Valid` is recorded meanwhile, so the node withholds its Prepare vote. Commit votes are not guarded directly; the bound reaches every `CommitQC` through its PrepareQC. |
| CT2 | **Scope.** The apply and replay path of certified blocks never consults the clock. Genesis keeps its existing check. |
| CT3 | **Builder pacing.** The payload builder includes no transaction with `creation_time_ms > local_wall_ms`, and does not propose while the block's canonical time would exceed `local_wall_ms`; it waits instead. |
| CT4 | **Bound.** `max_clock_drift_ms ≤ MAX_CLOCK_DRIFT_BOUND_MS` at genesis and in `validate_parameter_change`. |
| CT5 | **Stale due work.** The global executor answers `Failed(StaleDueWork)` for a block executed with `certified = false` that satisfies the keepalive validity predicate of K2 (§4.7), while `local_wall_ms − t(block) > gov.due_work_max_lag_ms`. Panel draws, seat replacement, lapse cleanup, resyncs and key-change rotations alone never trigger it. |

`certified` is set by the Sumeragi core on `Action::Execute` iff the node holds
a PrepareQC for the block (a re-proposal or its own lock). A re-proposal keeps
the certified block's original time, and nodes that discarded the execution,
sat behind a hidden PrepareQC or restarted must execute it again: without the
exemption, a due-work block whose PrepareQC was hidden for longer than
`gov.due_work_max_lag_ms` could never gather Prepare votes again. The exemption
is sound because the PrepareQC's honest signers passed CT1 and CT5 when they
first voted. The verdict never depends on `certified`.

**Properties used by SCCP** (`specs/sumeragi.md` §4.5 proves them; every honest
wall clock is within `ε` of real time, with `2ε ≤ max_clock_drift_ms`):

- **Upper bound.** For a committee with at most `f` Byzantine members, a
  certified block time is at most `W_j + 2·max_clock_drift_ms` for any
  individual honest clock `W_j` at any later moment. A deadline anchored at
  certified time can therefore fire up to `2·max_clock_drift_ms` early relative
  to an individual honest clock. Wallet and relayer margins are
  `2·max_clock_drift_ms` plus inclusion latency.
- **Lower bound for anchors.** Every block that anchors governance work or a
  heartbeat has `t(h) ≥ W_i − gov.due_work_max_lag_ms` for some honest first
  Prepare voter, at the moment of that first Prepare.
- **Commit lag.** Between the first honest Prepare and the commit, view
  changes, a hidden PrepareQC or a halt can add unbounded delay, so an anchor
  can be older than wall time at commit. Recovery for SCCP anchors is
  deterministic: a heartbeat or key change with a stale start gives the
  successor a shorter trust window, and if `BEAT` then holds again the next
  block makes a fresh heartbeat; a fast pause with a stale enactment time holds
  for less time and can be renewed (§4.14.7); liability uses the liability
  clock and destination progress, not anchors (§4.8). Parliament anchors have
  the same lag; the ballot spec anchors a ballot's closure to the block after
  its opening, so a stale opening never shortens voting (§4.7.2 G2b;
  `specs/parliament_private_ballot_design.md` §3.4).
- **Liveness.** An honest leader's fresh block satisfies CT1 at every honest
  voter whose clock is within `max_clock_drift_ms` of the leader's; CT5 is
  satisfied by including a fresh keepalive (§4.7 K4); certified re-proposals
  are exempt; larger skew only delays votes.

### 4.4 Outbound: `RecordSccpMessage`

```
RecordSccpMessage {
    network: SccpNetworkV1,     // external target
    expected_revision: u32,     // the revision the wallet verified (§7.1)
    amount: Numeric,            // XOR (§0)
    recipient: Vec<u8>,         // bytes for the target's recipient codec (§3.1)
}
```

This is a plain signed instruction, not a contract call. The authority is the
sender. Execution runs these steps in order:

1. SCCP is enabled. The route for `network` has exactly one revision `r` in
   `Bidirectional` (§4.14.2), `r = expected_revision`, the effective Taira hold
   `hold(r, t)` is false (Parliament pause, fast pause, forgery hold and
   quarantine, §4.14.2), `r` was never quarantined (a quarantined revision
   never records again, including after reconciliation, §4.10), and the
   destination of `r` is not paused: `destination_paused(r)` is false and `r`
   has no unexpired fast-pause part (§4.14.7).
2. Finality liveness: the parent's `sccp_degraded_run = 0`, else
   `SccpFinalityDegraded` (§4.6). This prevents locking funds that no active
   `X` would cover.
3. `a = taira_units(amount)` is exact (§0), `a ≥ min_outbound_amount`, and `a <
   2^96` for TON.
4. The authority's `AccountAddress` bytes are at most 1024 bytes.
5. `recipient` is valid for the target codec (§3.1) and passes every recipient
   rule the destination enforces (§5.1.5): EVM, nonzero and not the revision's
   contract address; TON, workchain 0, nonzero account id and not the minter
   account.
6. `liability(r) + a ≤ max_wrapped_supply(r)`.
7. The block has fewer than 512 leaves (transfers and controls, §3.4).
8. Transfer `a` XOR from the authority to the route escrow (§4.15), and set
   `liability(r) += a`.
9. `nonce = next_outbound_nonce(r)`, then `next_outbound_nonce(r) += 1`. Nonces
   are dense per revision, starting at 0.
10. `deadline_ms = creation_time_ms(block) + outbound_ttl_ms`.
11. Build the payload (§3.2) with `source_domain 0`, `dest_domain` of
    `network`, and `sender_codec 3` = the authority's `AccountAddress` bytes.
    Compute `payload_hash`, `message_id` and the transfer `leaf` (with `r`'s
    destination word).
12. Allocate `commitment_index` = the number of leaves already recorded in this
    block. A failed transaction releases its indices by state rollback.
13. Insert `sccp_outbound_messages[message_id] = SccpOutboundMessageRecordV1 {
    network, revision, nonce, height, commitment_index, deadline_ms, sender:
    AccountId, amount: a, payload, leaf, status: Recorded }`,
    `sccp_block_leaves[(height, commitment_index)] = Transfer(message_id)` and
    `sccp_outbound_by_nonce[(network, revision, nonce)] = message_id`.
14. Emit `SccpMessageRecorded { message_id, network, revision, nonce, height,
    commitment_index, deadline_ms }`.

Ordinary fees apply. Taira cannot observe mints; the destination's consumed set
is authoritative (§5). A record leaves `Recorded` only through a proven void
(§4.16); a minted record stays `Recorded`.

**Where it executes.** `RecordSccpMessage` executes only as an instruction of a
signed transaction (an `Instructions` executable or an instruction item of a
`Batch`) or as an instruction of a multisig proposal whose quorum is reached by
signed `MultisigApprove` transactions; it then records from the multisig
account. Every opaque deferred executable is refused before its first effect
with `NotPermitted`: a trigger body (user- or contract-registered), the queued
effects of an IVM program or contract call, an `IvmProved` overlay, and a
multisig proposal or approval that one of these derives. Trigger registration
(as an invalid parameter) and the IVM `CREATE_TRIGGER` syscall (with
`PermissionDenied`) refuse an action that contains the record directly, in a
batch or overlay, in a nested trigger registration or in a multisig proposal;
execution re-checks every derived group, including live multisig approvals. The
other SCCP instructions keep their own rules.

Contract-originated SCCP sends (Kotodama) are not part of v1: Kotodama has no
SCCP builtin, and the ABI v1 syscall `0xA0` defines the single operation tag
`1=SubmitBallot`. The IVM hosts reject every other tag, and every instruction
other than `SubmitBallot`, with `PermissionDenied`, so an encoded
`RecordSccpMessage` fails under any tag (§11). The post-execution commitment
(§4.5) would support contract-originated sends safely later.

### 4.5 Block commitment, history and finality header (post-execution)

The block header carries no SCCP root: a block's commitment root exists in its
post-execution world state and in its finality header `X`, which the certified
result binds (§3.6).

All SCCP instructions are routed to the universal dataspace and execute
serially in one execution context, so nonce assignment and `commitment_index`
allocation are deterministic. The governance block-start pass (§4.7), including
Parliament and fast-pause enactments, runs before the block's transactions, so
the control leaves of a block precede its transfer leaves.

```
sccp_block_leaves: (u64 height, u32 commitment_index) → SccpLeafRefV1 =
    | Transfer(message_id)                              // §4.4
    | Control { network, revision, control_nonce }       // §4.14.6
```

In `ValidBlock::finalize_owned_execution_metadata`
(`crates/iroha_core/src/block/post_execution_tail.rs`), after all transactions
of block `h` have executed and before the output seal, the SCCP hook runs in
this order:

1. **Commitment and history.** Read the applied leaf outbox
   `sccp_block_leaves[(h, ·)]` and assert that its indices are exactly `0..m`;
   a gap is an execution invariant violation and fails the block. If `m > 0`,
   compute `root` per §3.4 over the stored leaves of the referenced transfer
   and control records, append `history_leaf(h, root, m)` to the accumulator
   (§3.5), and write `sccp_block_commitments[h] = { root, message_count: m,
   history_index }`.
2. **Generation step.** G4, then G7 if it applies, then G2 (§4.2.2).
3. **Anchor append** (A1).
4. **Pruning** (§4.11), then the destination-progress gate L5 (§4.8).
5. **Finality header.** Produce `X_h` per §3.6 and G5 (§4.6).

These writes are part of the post-state covered by the execution commitment,
and `X_h` is part of the certified result itself, so a `CommitQC` of `h`
authenticates them with no vote-wire change.

### 4.6 Finality header production and failure semantics

**Producer and plumbing.**

1. `sccp::hook::finalize_block` returns `SccpFinalityHeaderV1`. It is a pure
   read of the post-execution World (after steps 1–4 of §4.5), `t(h)`, the
   `NetworkId` and the authenticated `SccpHeightInputsV1`. It reads no clock,
   configuration, Kura or hash-map iteration order. It returns `SccpLocalFault`
   only for a node-local resource or storage failure, which the executor maps
   to `Failed` (retry), never to `Invalid`; inconsistent SCCP state yields an
   inactive `X` or a resync, never an error.
2. `ExecutionOutputSealMetadata` gains `sccp_finality_header:
   SccpFinalityHeaderV1`, and the executor passes it to
   `sumeragi::commitment::execution_result`, which returns
   `RetainedPayload<CertifiedResultV1>`. The added field is a fixed-size inline
   `[u8; 221]` with no owned allocation, and the `unsafe map_payload` SAFETY
   note says so.
3. `encode_result_preimage` writes `X`, then the canonical body, into one
   buffer charged for `221 + len(body)`, and refuses a body over 65 315 bytes
   with `ResultPreimageError::PreimageLength`.
   `ExecutionResultCommitment::result()` is deleted, because `R` cannot be
   computed without `X`.
4. `X` travels with the original execution owner and is never recomputed from
   another state view.
5. **Voting.** There is no separate pre-vote check. Each voter's own `X` and
   `R` go into its vote. A divergent `X` gives a divergent `R` and so
   `LocalFault(ExecutionMismatch)`; replay re-executes, and the apply path
   halts on divergence (`specs/sumeragi.md` §12.5).

The finality header, generation and anchor bookkeeping never make a block
`Invalid`; only the content rules K1, K2 and R-EX do (§4.7, §4.9).

**Missing inputs (degraded).** If SCCP exists on Taira and the authenticated
inputs of `h` are missing (G4): `X_h` is produced in inactive form;
`sccp_degraded_run` is incremented (it counts consecutive degraded blocks
ending at the tip, and the next non-degraded block resets it to 0);
`SccpFinalityDegraded { height, reason }` is emitted; and G2 and G7 do not run
at `h`. While `sccp_degraded_run > 0`, `RecordSccpMessage` is refused with
`SccpFinalityDegraded`. While `sccp_degraded_run ≥ 2`, no heartbeat is due and
a keepalive is not valid on SCCP grounds (§4.7), so a persistent defect
produces at most two fee-free blocks, while a transient defect still gets one
keepalive retry on an idle chain.

**Missed boundary (resync).** If the inputs are present but the current
generation's root differs from `committee_root(C_h)`, a key change was missed
at a degraded boundary. G7 creates a resync generation, and `X_h` is produced
normally. Destinations still at the old generation cannot follow a resync,
because no certificate of that generation names the successor; they freeze at
their deadline.

**Recovery.** The condition is evaluated per block and is not sticky. Messages
already recorded stay in the history and become provable under any later active
`X`. If the defect persists, destinations freeze at their deadline, and value
drains through `voidFrozen` and inbound void settlement. Under consensus both
paths are unreachable without a bug: the inputs of `h + 1` exist once boundary
`h` is applied. Unauthenticated component executions
(`SccpHeightSourceV1::Unauthenticated`) produce an inactive `X`; fixtures that
need an active `X` MUST supply authenticated inputs.

**Evidence never reads the degraded state.** An `ACTIVE` certificate at a
degraded height has an `R` that differs from the recorded anchor, so it is
forgery evidence under E4 (§4.9).

### 4.7 Keepalive and the governance clock

SCCP owns the governance clock's due predicate and the shared keepalive (§14
D17); the Parliament workstream owns the ballot items that the pass runs.

#### 4.7.1 Clock rules

- **Millisecond deadlines.** A due item is applied by the block-start pass of
  the first block `B` with `t(B) ≥ due_ms`. Deadlines are canonical block times
  in milliseconds, never block counts. Height-indexed values stay height-based:
  beacon pulse slots, recorded `*_at_height` fields and the validation-fee
  activation offset.
- **Intents in transactions, transitions at block start.** Transactions record
  facts and intents only (responses, endorsements, ballots, phase-advance
  intents, proposals). Lifecycle transitions, including early closes, panel
  conclusions, ballot openings and closures, certification and enactment, are
  applied by Core's block-start pass. A transaction that satisfies an
  early-close condition sets a pending flag with `due_ms = t(B)`.
- **Anchors.** Only transitions applied by the pass take a time anchor, and
  each takes `t(B)` of the block whose pass applies it: body draws, entry into
  Reflection, ballot casting openings (`s0`), certifications and fast-pause
  enactments. Every other deadline is a fixed offset from an anchor, computed
  when the anchor is applied, and never moves.
- Converting the remaining height-based Parliament windows (invitation and
  deliberation) to this clock is part of this work (§12, coordinated with the
  Parliament workstream).

#### 4.7.2 Block-start pass

S0 (§4.2) runs first and is not part of the pass. The pass runs, on the global
chain's ordinary carrier only, in this order under the shared budget
`gov.governance_block_start_work_units` (default 64):

- **G0** pause-panel draw (§4.14.7). Outside the budget; not due work.
- **G1** Parliament sortition, at the exact pulse slot, in the request order of
  the Parliament pipeline.
- **G2** transitions with `due_ms ≤ t(B)`, in three segments:
  - **G2a**, ranks 0–3, in `(due_ms, kind_rank, item key)` order. Ranks 0–2
    are Parliament lifecycle transitions (phase-advance intents, invitation
    closes, public-finding conclusions), whose keys and costs the Parliament
    workstream fixes. Rank 3 is the SCCP rank: the pause-panel conclusion,
    keyed `(network tag, panel role)` with the primary first (§4.14.7), and
    the end of a reconciliation window, keyed `(network tag, revision)`
    (§4.10).
  - **G2b**, rank 4: binding-ballot closures whose closing time
    `t(h_open + 1) + casting_window_ms` has been reached, in `(closing time,
    governance_attempt_id, body_role)` order. `h_open = s0.height` is the
    opening block; closure is anchored to the first block executed after it,
    not to `s0`, so an opening that is already stale when it commits never
    shortens voting (`specs/parliament_private_ballot_design.md` §3.4, §3.7).
    The closing time is fixed when block `h_open + 1` executes and never
    moves.
  - **G2c**, rank 5: binding-ballot openings with `opening_at ≤ t(B)`,
    previously deferred ones included, in `(opening_at,
    governance_attempt_id, body_role)` order, each only while fewer than `K`
    casting windows are open. A window counts as open until its closure is
    processed. The first opening that finds no free slot ends G2c; it is not
    processed, keeps its place, and its deferral consumes no retry
    (`specs/parliament_private_ballot_design.md` §3.6, §8).
  - Ranks 6–8 are reserved and have no item kind. Adding one changes this
    section and the ballot spec together.

  Each segment reads the state that the earlier steps of the pass left, so a
  closure in G2b frees its slot for an opening in G2c of the same pass, and a
  Reflection entry in G2a whose `opening_at` has already been reached opens
  its ballot in G2c of the same pass. An item that a transition makes due in
  its own segment or an earlier one waits for the next pass.
- **G3** enactments: Parliament certificates first, in `(enact_not_before_ms,
  governance_attempt_id)` order, then fast pauses, in `(network tag, panel
  role)` order, each in its own rollback-isolated transaction.
- **G4** fast-pause lapse cleanup (§4.14.7), in network-tag order. Not due
  work, outside the budget and not positioned; at most one record per external
  network.

**Budget.** Each G1–G3 item has a fixed cost set by its owner (an enactment
costs 4, a pause-panel conclusion or reconciliation end 1). The first item of a
pass is always processed; after that, processing stops at the first item whose
cost exceeds the remaining budget, order is never skipped, and leftover items
stay due. A ballot closure that the budget defers changes no corpus, because
block validation checks each ballot against its own block's timestamp (ballot
spec §3.6); a deferred opening takes its `s0` at the pass that opens it.

**Positions.** Every processed G1–G3 item gets a position: its 0-based index
among the items processed in that block's pass, in processing order. Ballot
openings record theirs in `s0`, and fast-pause enactments record theirs in
`enacted_at`; the lift rule compares them (§4.14.7). Because G2c precedes G3, a
ballot that opens in the block of a fast-pause enactment always has the
smaller position. S0, G0 and G4 are not positioned.
`governance_due_applied` is true iff at least one G1, G2 or G3 item was
processed.

#### 4.7.3 Due predicate

```
keepalive_due(parent, h, t) := sccp_due(parent, t) ∨ governance_due(parent, h, t)

sccp_due(parent, t) := SCCP exists
                     ∧ parent.sccp_degraded_run < 2
                     ∧ t ≥ current.start_timestamp_ms + committee_heartbeat_ms   // G2 BEAT would fire

governance_due(parent, h, t) :=
     ∃ unconsumed Parliament pulse request with pulse_height = h          // the exact slot only
  ∨ ∃ G2a or G2b item with due_ms ≤ t                                   // deadlines, pending early-close flags, reconciliation ends, ballot closures
  ∨ ∃ ballot opening with opening_at ≤ t while fewer than K casting windows are open   // G2c
  ∨ ∃ certified attempt with enact_not_before_ms ≤ t                     // G3
  ∨ ∃ fast-pause round with certify_due                                  // §4.14.7
  ∨ ∃ item carried over by the block-start budget
```

- **Admission** evaluates the predicate on the committed tip, with `h = tip +
  1` and `t = c + 1`, where `c` is the keepalive's `creation_time_ms`.
  Execution validity is K2.
- A pulse request is due only at its exact slot. A slot that passes without its
  pulse leaves the request waiting for that exact pulse
  (`specs/parliament_private_ballot_design.md` §9); it is not due work, so a
  missing beacon never manufactures blocks. `TODO:` (WP-S3, with the
  Parliament availability-isolation step, ballot spec §12.2): the due leg for a
  late pulse; under the progress invariant below it may make a request due only
  in a pass that consumes it. Fast-pause lapses and panel draws are not due,
  because they act by time alone or wait for a boundary pulse.
- **Progress invariant** (normative for every present and future term). An item
  may appear in `governance_due` only if the block-start pass that finds it due
  consumes or terminalizes it. An item that waits for external material is not
  due. So every keepalive block strictly shrinks the due set or creates a
  generation, and an idle chain makes at most one block per due item.

#### 4.7.4 `Keepalive` and block rules

`Keepalive {}` (wire id `iroha.chain.keepalive.v1`) is one shared chain-level
instruction with no fields, and its execution is a no-op. A transaction that
carries it carries nothing else.

| # | Rule |
|---|---|
| K1 | **At most one** `Keepalive` per block. A block with two is `Invalid` (`DuplicateKeepalive`). |
| K2 | **Must apply due work.** A block that contains a `Keepalive` is valid only if `governance_due_applied` holds, or SCCP exists, `BEAT` (§4.2.2) holds at that block and the parent's `sccp_degraded_run < 2`. Otherwise it is `Invalid` (`KeepaliveNotDue`). The verdict is deterministic, from content, parent state and block time. It is keyed on `BEAT`, not on G2 actually running, so a block that degrades at its own height cannot make an honest heartbeat keepalive invalid. CT5 triggers on exactly this predicate. |
| K3 | **Fees.** Exempt, from any Ed25519 authority, registered or not, with no fee field (§4.19). |
| K4 | **Honest proposer.** It includes a keepalive only if its candidate block `B` will satisfy K2, which it decides without executing, because the pass depends only on the parent state, `t(B)` and the pulses `B` carries; in particular a keepalive due only because of a pulse request at slot `h` is included only if `B` carries that pulse. It includes at most one: the due one with the latest `creation_time` not above its clock plus drift. If its candidate would satisfy K2 with `local_now − t(B) > gov.due_work_max_lag_ms / 2`, it replaces any keepalive with a fresh one of its own, which satisfies CT5. It drops keepalives that are no longer due. |
| K5 | **Admission** (Torii and P2P ingress): the exact shape; `c ≤ local_wall_ms + max_clock_drift_ms`; and `keepalive_due(tip, tip + 1, c + 1)`. The pulse leg counts a request at slot `tip + 1`; whether the block carries the pulse is the builder's decision (K4). The queue drops a pending keepalive when a newer tip makes it not due. Peers MAY deduplicate locally. |

**Guarantees.** Through CT1 a keepalive cannot advance Taira time: its block
waits until honest clocks reach `c − max_clock_drift_ms`. Through CT5 and K4,
due work and heartbeats are anchored within `gov.due_work_max_lag_ms` of honest
time. Through K2 and the progress invariant, no block exists without due work,
and an idle chain produces one block per `committee_heartbeat_ms` plus one per
governance item; a persistent degraded run produces at most two keepalive
blocks. Through `Execute.certified`, a re-proposed due-work block is never
blocked by CT5.

**Who submits.** Anyone. Validators run the keeper (§4.13.4), which signs with
its node-local Ed25519 `keeper_key`. Committee members stagger: each submits
when `local_wall_ms ≥ due_time + rank · keepalive_stagger_ms` and nothing is
pending, where `rank` is its canonical index and `due_time` is
`current.start_timestamp_ms + committee_heartbeat_ms` for a heartbeat, or the
item's due time for governance work (with a `rank · 1 000 ms` stagger). Juror
and panel wallets MAY submit.

**Deleted.** `heartbeat_start_work_pending`, `apply_block_start` and
`sccp_heartbeat_marker` (`hook.rs`), and the SCCP part of
`State::deterministic_start_work_pending` (with the function itself unless
another caller exists).

### 4.8 Validator liability: exit delay, liability clock and destination progress

**Liability clock.**

```
lc(genesis) = t(genesis)
lc(h)       = lc(h − 1) + min(t(h) − t(h − 1), committee_heartbeat_ms + SCCP_LC_SLACK_MS)
```

S0 stores `lc(h)` in `sccp_liability_clock` before any transaction of `h`. On a
running chain consecutive blocks are at most `committee_heartbeat_ms` plus
keepalive latency apart (§4.7), so `lc` follows `t`. After a halt, the first
block advances `lc` by at most one step, so neither the outage nor that block's
time jump consumes a liability window. Always `lc ≤ t`, so a window measured in
`lc` never ends earlier, in `t`, than the same window measured in `t`.

**Liable predicate.** One inclusive predicate serves evidence admission (E0),
the stake release gate (L3) and pruning:

```
liable(g) at block h :=
      g = sccp_committee_current
   ∨ lc(h) ≤ rec.liable_until_lc                                              // time leg
   ∨ (rec.dest_cleared_lc = None    ∧ lc(h) ≤ rec.liable_until_lc + rec.progress_cap_ms)
   ∨ (rec.dest_cleared_lc = Some(c) ∧ lc(h) ≤ c + rec.grace_ms)              // destination-progress leg
```

All transactions of one block see the same `lc(h)` and the same parent-state
`dest_cleared_lc`, so evidence and an unbond in one block get one answer,
whatever their order.

| # | Rule |
|---|---|
| L1 | **Delay and slash rate.** While SCCP exists, `nexus.staking.unbonding_delay_ms ≥ committee_validity_ms + forgery_evidence_grace_ms` for the current parameters and for every retained generation's `validity_ms + grace_ms`, and `nexus.staking.max_slash_bps ≥ 1`. Both values are node configuration pinned by the genesis Nexus consensus-policy digest (`NexusConsensusStakingV1`), not chain parameters. They are enforced (a) by `InitializeSccpV1` against the genesis-pinned policy, so a genesis that fails them is invalid; (b) by `irohad`, which refuses to start when SCCP exists in state and the configured policy fails them (the digest already refuses any other change); and (c) by the Parliament's `SetParameters`, which checks the parameter side against the pinned policy. Kagami's SCCP-enabled profiles set `unbonding_delay_ms = 1 814 400 000` (21 d) and `max_slash_bps = 10 000`; the global default unbonding delay of 0 stays for chains without SCCP. |
| L2 | **Liability anchor.** A forgery against generation `g` is a root-consensus offence at offence height `start_height(g)`: the penalty uses `ConsensusSlashLiability::Root(start_height(g))`. The liable exposure is bonded stake plus every pending unbond whose `slashable_through_height ≥ start_height(g)`, which is exactly the stake that backed `g`. |
| L3 | **Release gate.** `FinalizePublicLaneUnbond` of a pending unbond of validator `v` with `slashable_through_height = H` is refused with `SccpLiabilityActive` while some retained `g` with `v ∈ members(g)` and `start_height(g) ≤ H` is `liable(g)`, and with `SccpPenaltyPending` while a `Pending` SCCP forgery record names `v`, until its penalty is `Applied`. The same two conditions refuse the pruning of an exited zero-custody validator and a `RegisterPublicLaneValidator` that replaces `v`'s exited record (a re-registration would otherwise give `v` a registration that G6 never named). The gate adds to the existing `unbond_liability_release_height` check and scans at most the retained generations. |
| L4 | **Exit is never blocked.** `ExitPublicLaneValidator` is unchanged. A validator leaves the committee at the next election; only the release of its stake waits. |
| L5 | **Destination-progress gate.** In the post-execution hook, after pruning, Core visits at most 64 retained, ended generations with `dest_cleared_lc = None`, in ascending order, and sets `dest_cleared_lc = lc(h)` iff, for every network that has a non-`Retired` route revision, the network's active inbound light client has a finalized checkpoint with `source_time_ms > deadline_ms(g)`; it then emits `SccpGenerationDestinationCleared { generation, lc }`. A network with such a revision but no active light client blocks the clearance. With no such network, as before launch, clearance is immediate. |

**Why L5.** A destination accepts `g` while its own block time is at most
`deadline_ms(g)`, and that time is chosen by the destination's proposers. After
a multi-day BSC or TON halt, the first blocks can carry old timestamps, and one
malicious proposer could include a forged rotation of an expired generation
after Taira had released the collateral. Destination timestamps strictly
increase, so once a finalized header with a time above the deadline exists, no
later block of that chain accepts `g`, and every earlier block is final and
public. L5 waits until Taira's light client sees such a header, then leaves
`grace_ms` of liability clock for evidence. The time leg keeps the bound while
light clients are current, and the cap bounds the stake lock when a destination
halts or nobody advances its light client.

**Guarantee: the exit delay keeps every signer bonded.** Let `v` be a member of
`g`, and consider the stake that backed `g`. It is either still bonded, or a
pending unbond with `slashable_through_height ≥ start_height(g)` (the
validator's next scheduled deactivation height minus one, so stake keeps
backing every generation that starts before that boundary, heartbeat
generations of the same epoch included). L3 keeps such an unbond in custody
while `g` is liable, and E0 admits evidence against `g` exactly while `g` is
liable. Once evidence is recorded, L3 holds the stake until the penalty
applies, and the record carries everything the penalty needs (§4.9). So
whenever forgery evidence is admissible against `v`, the stake that backed `g`
has not left custody. L1 makes the ordinary unbonding wait cover the time leg,
so L3 binds only in edge cases (stake unbonding mid-epoch that still backs a
later heartbeat generation, parameter changes, halts in which `lc` lags `t`,
slow destination progress); L3 is what makes the guarantee unconditional.
Liability follows the registration that G6 resolved at generation creation, not
the key: a key cannot be rebound after activation, and L3 refuses a replacing
re-registration while liability lasts.

**Residual assumptions** (§9.1): relay, watch and Taira inclusion latency
together stay below `grace_ms` (7 d by default); a destination chain's
finalized time does not stay at or below a generation's deadline for longer
than `grace_ms + progress_cap_ms` past it (37 d by default) and then resume
with backdated blocks, and its light client is not left unadvanced that long;
and the inbound light clients are safe, which inbound SCCP already assumes.

### 4.9 Forgery evidence and slashing: `SubmitSccpForgeryEvidenceV1`

```
SubmitSccpForgeryEvidenceV1 {
    qc: [u8; 117],                          // QC_FIXED (§3.7)
    header: [u8; 221],                      // X
    aggregate_signature: [u8; 96],          // compressed σ
    anchor: Option<SccpAnchorWitnessV1>,    // required only when X.height lies in a completed anchor chunk
}
SccpAnchorWitnessV1 { core_hash: [u8; 32], result: [u8; 32], path: [[u8; 32]; 12] }
```

A transaction that carries it carries nothing else. Anyone can build the
witness from Kura (§6). The steps are identical at admission and at execution:
at admission they run against the committed tip, with `h_exec = tip + 1`, `t =
tx.creation_time_ms` and `lc = lc(tip) + min(t − t(tip), committee_heartbeat_ms +
SCCP_LC_SLACK_MS)`; at execution they run against the parent state with
`lc(h_exec)`. Steps run in order, and the first failure is the result.

1. SCCP exists, `X` parses (X1–X7), `ACTIVE` is set, and `X.network_id` is the
   live `NetworkId`. Otherwise `NotEvidence`: an inactive or foreign `X` makes
   no SCCP claim.
2. Let `g = X.generation` and `rec = sccp_committee_generations[g]`. A missing
   record gives `EvidenceExpired` when `g ≤ current`, else
   `EvidenceUnknownGeneration`. If `X.committee_root ≠ rec.committee_root`, the
   result is `NotEvidence`: keys that Taira never certified are not validators.
3. **E0 (window).** `liable(g)` (§4.8), else `EvidenceExpired`.
4. **Signature.** The §3.8 destination relation holds with `rec.keys`, Taira's
   `I` and `q(n)`, verified with
   `iroha_crypto::bls::consensus::verify_fast_aggregate_committed`; else
   `BadSignature`.
5. **Mismatch.** The first matching rule applies; if none matches, the result
   is `NotEvidence`:

   | # | Predicate | Meaning |
   |---|---|---|
   | E1 | `X.height < rec.start_height`, or `rec.end = Some(e) ∧ X.height > e.end_height` | Signed outside the generation's tenure. No anchor is needed. |
   | E2 | `X.height ≥ h_exec` | A height Taira has not committed. Through parent hashes, any genuine certificate at such a height would depend on the payload of block `h_exec`, which contains this evidence. |
   | E3 | `X.height < h_exec ∧ qc.block_hash ≠ anchor(X.height).core_hash` | Not Taira's block at that height. |
   | E4 | `X.height < h_exec`, the block hash equals the anchor's, and `SHA-256(RESULT_TAG ‖ X ‖ qc.result_body) ≠ anchor(X.height).result` | Taira's block with a result Taira never certified: a false `X`, a false `D_body`, or both. |

   `anchor(a)` follows §4.2.1. Its errors are `WitnessRequired` (a witness is
   needed and absent), `BadWitness` (the path does not reach
   `sccp_anchor_chunks[c]`) and `EvidenceExpired` (the chunk root was pruned).
   A certificate that fails E1–E4 is genuine, its block hash and result being
   Taira's, including a genuine certificate with a different valid signer set;
   it is never evidence, whoever submits it. Admission is only a pre-check: a
   node whose tip lags can admit a genuine certificate under E2, and the
   builder's recheck against the parent state then finds it `NotEvidence` and
   drops it. E2 is sound at execution, where the hash-chain argument applies.

   **Why honest signers are not slashed.** If `g` has at most `f` Byzantine
   members, an honest Prepare voter signs only an `R` it computed from a valid
   proposal, and an honest Commit voter signs only a PrepareQC'd value of its
   current view. The one gap is up to `f` honest Commit votes on a block that
   never committed (§9.12); a certificate built on them needs `f + 1` further
   keys of `g`, which exceeds `g`'s BFT bound. Strict liability then slashes
   those honest stray signers too (§9.12).
6. **Offenders.** For each set bit `i`, the offender is `rec.members[i]`, the
   G6 binding `(lane, validator, activation_height)`. A `None` member is
   recorded as unslashable and emits `SccpForgeryOffenderUnslashable`.
7. **Deduplication.** The new offenders are those with no
   `sccp_forgery_offences[(g, lane, validator)]` entry. If there are none, the
   result is `EvidenceDuplicate`. Each validator is penalized at most once per
   generation; a second certificate with other signers penalizes only them
   (certificates are per node, `specs/bridge_finality.md`).
8. **Record.** Inside the transaction:
   - `evidence_id = H_iroha("sccp/forgery-evidence/v1" ‖ be64(g) ‖ m ‖
     be32(signers))`;
   - append a consensus `EvidenceRecord` whose `evidence` field is the closed
     enum `RecordedEvidenceV1 { Native(Evidence),
     SccpForgery(SccpForgeryRecordV1) }`, with `SccpForgeryRecordV1 { evidence:
     SubmitSccpForgeryEvidenceV1, rule: E1..E4, generation: g, start_height:
     rec.start_height, offenders: Vec<SccpForgeryOffenderV1 { signer: u32,
     lane_id, validator, activation_height }> }`;
   - attribution: `scope: EvidenceScope::SccpGeneration { generation: g }` and
     `instance: I`; `height: rec.start_height`, the offence height (L2), not
     `X.height`; `epoch` and `context_id` as signed in `QC_FIXED` (unverified);
     `authority_generation: rec.committee_root`; `offenders`: the new offenders
     as signer index, the key's peer id and `lane_stake: None`;
     `safety_violation: true`;
   - `penalty_status: Pending`; insert `sccp_forgery_offences` for each new
     offender; set `sccp_forgery_max_generation = max(·, g)` (§4.10);
   - emit `SccpForgeryEvidenceRecorded { evidence_id, generation, height:
     X.height, rule, offenders }`.
9. **Penalty.** The consensus penalty pipeline
   (`crates/iroha_core/src/sumeragi/penalties.rs`) applies the record after the
   immutable `slashing_delay_blocks`, counted from `recorded_at_height`. For
   `SccpForgery` records it uses neither the peer-key validator map nor the
   locator tenure filter, which would test an attacker-chosen height. For each
   offender it loads the `(lane, validator)` record and requires an equal
   `activation_height` (the same registration; L3 refuses replacement while
   liable), slashes `max_slash_amount(exposure, max_slash_bps)` with
   `ConsensusSlashLiability::Root(record.start_height)` (L2; the tenure check
   holds because G6 resolved the member for that generation's start), credits
   `slash_sink_account_id`, and marks the record `Applied`. The native evidence
   horizon of at most three epochs does not apply. Nothing in the penalty reads
   the generation record, so pruning cannot strand it; pruning also skips
   generations that pending records name (§4.11). On an idle chain the penalty
   waits for the next block, and L3 holds the stake meanwhile.

**Fees, admission and validity.**

- Exempt class `ForgeryEvidence`, quota 1 per block (§4.19). Any authority,
  registered or not, may submit.
- **Ingress** (Torii and P2P) checks, in this order: exact lengths and parsing
  (step 1); the record lookup and E0 (steps 2–3); step 5 without the signature
  (the E1/E2 classification or the anchor lookup and witness path);
  deduplication against state (step 7); an LRU of the last 4 096 `(g, m,
  signers)` triples seen, accepted or refused, which drops repeats; a node-wide
  token bucket of 8 pairings per second with a burst of 32; and only then the
  pairing (step 4). Refused submissions never reach the queue. Per-peer rate
  limits stay.
- **R-EX.** A block that contains a `ForgeryEvidence` transaction that fails at
  execution is `Invalid`. The verdict is deterministic, from the signed content
  and the parent state. An honest builder runs steps 1–7 against the certified
  parent state and the candidate block's canonical time before including one,
  and includes at most one per block, so honest blocks never trip R-EX, and a
  Byzantine leader cannot use failing evidence to make a free block.
- **Bounded cost.** The payload is `117 + 221 + 96 + 64 + 384` bytes plus
  framing. Execution costs one hash-to-curve, at most 31 point additions, one
  pairing check, at most 13 `H_iroha` for the path and O(1) map reads.

### 4.10 Forgery hold, quarantine and reconciliation

```
sccp_forgery_max_generation: Option<u64>    // the highest generation named by any recorded SCCP forgery evidence
SccpRouteRevisionV1 gains:
    forgery_floor: u64                       // the lowest generation the deployment may still be at; initially pin.generation
    quarantine: Option<SccpQuarantineV1 { certificate_id: [u8; 32], since_height: u64 }>
```

- **Held.** `forgery_held(r) := sccp_forgery_max_generation ≥
  Some(r.forgery_floor)`. A deployment can be at generation `g` only if `g ≥
  forgery_floor(r)`, because destinations move only forward (§5.1.2), so
  evidence for a lower generation cannot affect `r`.
- **Effect.** While `forgery_held(r) ∨ r.quarantine.is_some()`, and until `r`
  is reconciled (R3), `r` is held on Taira whatever its activation (§4.14.2):
  `RecordSccpMessage` to `r` is refused with `SccpForgeryHold`, and inbound
  settlement and outbound refunds of `r` stay `Pending`. This covers
  `InboundOnly` revisions, which `SetTairaPaused` cannot pause. Proofs, inbound
  proving, light clients, destination voids and governance continue.
- **Release by attestation.** The Parliament action
  `AttestSccpDeploymentProgress { network, revision, at }` (subject
  `ForgeryHold(network)`) takes `at ∈ { Generation { generation, committee_root
  }, Frozen }` and raises `forgery_floor(r)` to `generation`, or to `u64::MAX`
  for `Frozen`. Preconditions: `generation ≤ current`, and `committee_root`
  equals the record of `generation` while that record is retained. The revision
  is released as soon as `forgery_floor(r) > sccp_forgery_max_generation`. The
  attestation states a destination fact that reviewers check with `iroha sccp
  monitor`: the deployment's `committeeState()` names that genuine generation
  and root, or the deployment is frozen (expired or latched) at a genuine
  generation. Destinations never move backwards, so the attestation stays true.
- **Ordering.** Attestation and evidence commute. Evidence recorded later for a
  generation `≥ forgery_floor(r)` holds `r` again, which is correct, because
  the deployment may be at that generation.
- **Griefing.** Evidence for a generation that every deployment has passed
  holds nothing, so an already-slashed quorum that keeps signing with keys
  reused across heartbeat generations cannot re-arm a hold. Evidence changes no
  governance head, so it never supersedes a pending attestation.
- **Quarantine.** `QuarantineSccpRevision { network, revision }` (subject
  `ForgeryHold(network)`) sets `r.quarantine = { certificate_id, since_height
  }` from the enacting certificate, for a deployment that the Parliament finds
  captured: its `committeeState()` root is not a genuine Taira root, or
  `monitor` shows forged mints. The quarantine record is permanent: no
  attestation, lapse, Parliament resume or reconciliation removes it, and a
  quarantined revision never records outbound again (§4.4 step 1). What ends
  is the quarantine's hold on settlement: it ends at the end of the
  reconciliation window (R3), after which later claims settle at the
  reconciled rate (R4) and `r` can eventually retire (R5). A proposal that
  quarantines a `Bidirectional` or `Paused` revision normally also carries
  `DeactivateOutbound`, because a `Paused` revision keeps its claims held
  (§4.12.3).
- **Events** (§4.17). Recording evidence emits `SccpRevisionForgeryHeld` for
  each revision it newly holds; an attestation that releases a revision emits
  `SccpRevisionForgeryReleased`; quarantine emits `SccpRevisionQuarantined`;
  reconciliation emits `SccpReconciliationOpened`, `SccpForgedMintProven` per
  proven id, `SccpReconciliationSettled` at the window end and
  `SccpReconciledClaimSettled` per claim settled afterwards.
- **Why.** A captured deployment accepts only its attacker generation, so
  neither Taira controls nor fast pauses reach it (§5.1.2). Holding the
  revision on Taira is the only automatic protection of its escrow, and
  quarantine keeps that protection after the rest of the network resumes.
  Triggering a hold costs at least `f + 1` signers their stake (§9.11), and no
  single party can trigger it.

**Reconciliation of a quarantined revision (launch blocker).** `RegisterRoute`
is refused until this mechanism is implemented (§10.2); releasing a captured
revision without it would let attacker-minted burns drain its remaining
backing. Its state is:

```
sccp_reconciliations: (SccpNetworkV1, u32) → SccpReconciliationV1 {
    opened_at_ms: u64, closes_at_ms: u64,   // t(B) of the enacting block; + window_ms
    forged_supply: u128,                    // F: checked sum of the proven forged amounts
    proven_ids: BTreeSet<[u8; 32]>,
    rho: Option<(u128, u128)>,              // (B, B + F), fixed at the window end
    settled_face: u128,                     // S: face amount of r's claims settled under rho
}
```

A quarantined revision is in exactly one phase, derived from this record:
**Held** (no record), **Reconciling** (a record with `rho = None`) or
**Reconciled** (`rho = Some`). `refunds_pending(r)` is the sum of the amounts
of `r`'s `Voided` outbound records whose refund is still pending, kept as a
counter. `⊖` is saturating subtraction.

| # | Requirement |
|---|---|
| R1 | **Held and Reconciling.** Quarantine holds every pending and future inbound claim and outbound refund of `r` (`Pending{Held}`). Inbound proving and void proofs continue, so claims and refunds are recorded and wait. |
| R2 | **Window.** `OpenSccpReconciliation { network, revision, window_ms }` (Parliament, subject `ForgeryHold(network)`) requires `r` quarantined and no reconciliation record for `r`, so each revision has one window. It writes the record with `opened_at_ms = t(B)` of the enacting block and `closes_at_ms = t(B) + window_ms` (checked; an overflow fails the action at enactment). While the executing block's `t < closes_at_ms`, anyone may submit `ProveSccpForgedMintV1 { network, revision, proof }`: an inbound light-client proof of a destination `SccpFinalized` event of `r` for a message id that Taira never recorded for `r` (the id binds the payload hash, §3.3, so a forged payload under a genuine nonce is such an id). Each proven id adds its amount once to `F` and emits `SccpForgedMintProven`; a proof that would make `liability(r) + F` exceed `u128::MAX` is refused, so `B + F` (R3) always fits. `liability(r)` does not change while `r` is Held or Reconciling, because nothing records to or bounces into it and its claims and refunds are held. From `closes_at_ms` the instruction is refused, so a forged mint proven late prices nothing in. |
| R3 | **Window end: the quarantine's hold ends.** The first block-start pass with `t(B) ≥ closes_at_ms` runs the reconciliation end (G2a rank 3, due work, cost 1, §4.7.2). It does constant work: with `B = liability(r) ⊖ refunds_pending(r)`, it fixes `rho = (B, B + F)`, or `(0, 1)` when `B + F = 0`, and emits `SccpReconciliationSettled { network, revision, backing: B, forged_supply: F }`. From then on `r` is Reconciled: the quarantine leg and the forgery-hold leg of `hold(r, t)` no longer apply to it (§4.14.2), while its other legs (`Paused`, an unexpired fast pause, `¬enabled`) still do. `rho` never changes again. |
| R4 | **Later claims.** Every inbound claim of a Reconciled `r`, whether it was held across the window end or proven later, settles through the ordinary settlement and retry path (§4.12.3, `SettleSccpV1::Inbound`), in canonical execution order, with step 1 replaced by this payout. For claim amount `a`, `payout = min(liability(r) ⊖ refunds_pending(r), ⌊(S + a)·B / (B + F)⌋ − ⌊S·B / (B + F)⌋)`, computed exactly with 256-bit intermediates. Steps 2–7 run on `payout` instead of `a` (fee, bounce and credit included); step 1 never holds the record, because the cap replaces it. When the record leaves `Pending` (released, bounced or stranded), and only then, `S += a` (stored saturating at `u128::MAX`), step 7 or the bounce sets `liability(r) −= payout`, the final status records `payout`, the rest `a − payout` is void, and `SccpReconciledClaimSettled { network, revision, message_id, amount: a, payout }` is emitted. A refusal that keeps the record `Pending` (steps 4 and 6, or `BlockLeavesFull`) changes neither `S` nor `liability(r)`, and its retry recomputes the payout from the `S` of that moment. A zero payout releases the record with nothing credited, charged or bounced. While no void of `r` is proven after the window end, the cap never binds before `S` reaches `B + F`, and claims of exactly `B + F` face value receive exactly `B` in total, whatever their order; order changes only per-claim rounding and who bears a shortfall. Claims beyond `B + F` (forged mints not proven in the window, or minted after it, since a captured deployment keeps accepting its attacker generation) receive only the liability that remains, so later claimants carry the risk of unpriced forgery. Outbound refunds of `r` settle in full under §4.16; claims never take liability that backs a pending refund, and a refund that `liability(r)` no longer covers stays `Pending{LiabilityShortfall}`. |
| R5 | **Retirement.** A quarantined revision retires only when Reconciled, under the ordinary `RetireRevision` precondition (`liability(r) = 0` and no inbound record or refund of `r` `Pending`, §4.14.3). Until then it stays Reconciled indefinitely and keeps settling later claims under R4. Its quarantine record and its outbound refusal never end. |
| R6 | Deterministic, with bounded work per block: the window end is constant work, and each claim or refund is one ordinary settlement. Every step is evented. |

`TODO:` (Team S, launch blocker, §13 item 3): whether pro-rata pricing with a
proof window stays the rule or a claims bar date replaces it; the disposition
of liability that backs genuine messages the captured deployment never minted
and that no void proof can reach (their senders have no refund path, so
`liability(r) = 0`, and with it R5, may never be reached); and the Norito
layouts, events, Torii routes and `iroha sccp reconcile` tooling.

### 4.11 Storage and pruning

| Map | Retention |
|---|---|
| `sccp_outbound_messages`, `sccp_block_leaves`, `sccp_outbound_by_nonce` | permanent (one record per value transfer, ≤ 4 KiB payload) |
| `sccp_control_messages` | permanent (one record per recorded control, §4.14.6) |
| `sccp_block_commitments`, history leaves and peaks | permanent (~48 B per SCCP block) |
| `sccp_inbound_messages` | permanent (one record per inbound message) |
| `sccp_committee_generations` | pruned (below) |
| `sccp_anchor_open` / `sccp_anchor_chunks` | the open chunk (≤ 256 KiB) / pruned chunk roots (below) |
| `sccp_forgery_offences`, SCCP forgery evidence records | permanent |
| fast-pause panel, rounds, pauses and suspensions | current values only (§4.14.7) |
| `sccp_reconciliations` | permanent (one per reconciled revision) |
| light-client sets and checkpoints | §4.13.1 |
| `sccp_governance_revisions` | permanent (one counter per SCCP governance subject, §4.14.3) |
| Parliament proposals, attempts and certificates | owned by the Parliament pipeline |

**Pruning** runs in the post-execution hook, after G2 and G7 (§4.5):

- **Generation records.** Scan in ascending order and delete at most 8 records
  `g` with `g < sccp_committee_current`, `¬liable(g)` and no `Pending` SCCP
  forgery record naming `g`. Gaps are allowed; nothing assumes that a successor
  outlives its predecessor.
- **Anchor chunk roots.** Delete at most 8 chunk roots whose last height is
  below the smallest `start_height` of the retained generations. The open chunk
  is never deleted.

**Size.** A generation record is about 4 KB at `n = 31`. With the defaults,
generations are created at most 25 times a day and the retained window is about
21 days, so about 525 records are retained. The longest window the parameter
caps allow is 90 days (30 d validity, 30 d grace and the 30 d progress cap,
which applies only while a destination light client stalls), at most 4 320
records or about 17 MB at 48 rotations a day. Anchor chunk roots add about 21
entries a day at a 1 s cadence.

**Node-local.** The rotation archive and anchor witnesses are node-local (§6).
Old messages remain finalizable through the history root of any later
certificate (§3.5).

### 4.12 Inbound: prove, then settle

Inbound messages are proven once and settled separately, so a burn that is
proven never becomes unprovable. Settlement may be retried later without a
proof.

#### 4.12.1 `SubmitSccpInboundMessageV1` (prove)

```
SubmitSccpInboundMessageV1 {
    network: SccpNetworkV1,          // external source
    revision: u32,
    payload: Vec<u8>,                // §3.2
    proof: SccpSourceProofV1,        // per-chain enum, §4.13
}
```

Validation:

1. SCCP exists. Revision `r` of the route exists and is not `Staged`:
   `Bidirectional`, `Paused`, `InboundOnly` and `Retired` accept proofs.
   `enabled`, holds and quarantine do not affect proving.
2. The payload decodes (§3.2) with `source_domain` = the network's domain,
   `dest_domain = 0`, `route_revision = r`, `route_id` of the route and
   `deadline_ms = 0`.
3. `message_id`, recomputed per §3.3, is not in `sccp_inbound_messages`.
4. `proof` verifies against the network's light client (§4.13) and yields a
   normalized source event `{ kind: TransferToTaira, emitter, message_id,
   sender, nonce, payload_hash }`. Its `emitter` equals revision `r`'s
   deployment address, and its fields equal those recomputed from `payload`.
5. Verifier work is estimated from the frame alone (`SccpVerifierWorkV1`) and
   reserved under the `[zk.sccp]` transaction and block limits before any
   cryptography runs; advances and equivocation evidence are reserved the same
   way. A reservation reaches the block only when its transaction commits. A
   transaction carries at most one inbound or void proof, preceded by any
   number of `AdvanceSccpLightClientV1` instructions within the work limits.

Effect: insert `sccp_inbound_messages[message_id] = SccpInboundRecordV1 {
network, revision, payload, source_locator, proven_at_height, fee_due, status:
Pending }` and emit `SccpInboundProven`. Then attempt settlement (§4.12.3). If
settlement cannot complete, the record stays `Pending` with the reason of
§4.12.3 and the instruction still succeeds: every deterministic settlement
refusal is checked before any settlement effect runs, so only an execution
invariant violation fails the proof.

`SettleSccpV1 { target: Inbound(message_id) | Refund { network, revision, nonce
} }` retries a `Pending` inbound settlement or outbound refund (§4.16) without
a proof. Anyone may submit it, and it pays the ordinary fee, except a
recipient's settle that is an eligible self-claim (§4.12.4). It fails if it
changes nothing, so retry spam pays: a failed exempt settle is charged too
(§4.19).

#### 4.12.2 Source event binding per chain

| Source | Evidence of the burn | Normalized fields come from |
|---|---|---|
| ETH, BSC | Receipt log with `status = 1`, `address` = deployment, `topics = [0x79ac1cc6…, message_id, word(sender)]`, `data = abi.encode(uint64 nonce, bytes payload)` | log topics and data |
| TON | A transaction of the deployment (minter) account with successful compute and action phases and an external-out message whose body is `sccp_transfer_to_taira` (§5.3.3). The body's `amount`, `nonce` and `sender` (codec 7) MUST equal the payload's; the minter builds the payload from them, so a disagreement is refused | out-message body |

#### 4.12.3 Settlement

Settlement proceeds only when SCCP is enabled, revision `r` is `Bidirectional`
or `InboundOnly`, and `hold(r, t)` is false (§4.14.2). Otherwise the record
stays `Pending` with reason `Disabled`, `RevisionNotSettleable` or `Held`.
`Paused` holds it; `Retired` cannot hold one (§4.14.2). A quarantined revision
settles only once reconciled, with step 1 replaced by the payout of §4.10 R4
and steps 2–7 run on that payout. The steps run in this order,
and each refusal is checked without mutating state before the effects that
follow it:

1. If `liability(r) < amount`, the record stays `Pending{LiabilityShortfall}`
   and core emits `SccpInboundLiabilityShortfall`. A shortfall means the
   external side released more than Taira locked, which indicates a destination
   forgery, a source-chain compromise or a verifier compromise. The responses
   are forgery evidence (§4.9) and quarantine (§4.10) where a forged
   certificate exists, `ReportSccpLightClientEquivocationV1` where equivocation
   evidence exists, and otherwise a Parliament-enacted `FreezeLightClient`.
2. Decode `recipient` (codec 3) as `AccountAddress` and derive the `AccountId`.
   If decoding fails, bounce (§4.12.5) with `UndecodableRecipient`.
3. Bounce if the recipient can never be credited. These are permanent identity
   refusals:
   - it is an SCCP escrow account (`EscrowRecipient`);
   - its controller uses a signing algorithm or curve that account admission
     does not allow (`InadmissibleController`); or
   - it does not exist and `Register<Account>(Account::new(recipient))` refuses
     its identity (`UnregistrableRecipient`), for example a retired rekey
     identity or a reserved protocol escrow identity. Core decides this with
     the identity precheck that `Register<Account>` itself runs first, so the
     two cannot drift.
4. Let `fee = min(fee_due, amount)`. If `fee > 0` and the fee sink of the Nexus
   fee policy does not resolve to an existing account, the record stays
   `Pending{FeeSinkUnavailable}`.
5. If the account does not exist and `amount − fee > 0`, core registers
   `Account::new(recipient)`, with the same effect and validation-fee DS
   classification as `Register<Account>`, and emits `SccpRecipientRegistered`.
6. Core prechecks each credit of step 7 against every guard of the escrow
   release movement (transfer control, holding limit, custody, the XOR
   definition's transfer, usage and privacy policy). A refused recipient credit
   keeps the record `Pending{CreditRefused}`; a refused fee credit keeps it
   `Pending{FeeSinkUnavailable}`. These refusals can lift (the recipient raises
   its holding limit, say), so they hold rather than bounce. A registration
   made in step 5 stays.
7. Transfer `amount − fee` XOR from the route escrow to the recipient and `fee`
   to the fee sink (one combined credit when the sink is the recipient; a zero
   credit is skipped). Set `liability(r) −= amount` and `status = Released {
   height }`. Emit `SccpInboundReleased`.

A retry by `SettleSccpV1::Inbound` reruns these steps; it changes something
when the reason changes, a registration happens, or the message settles.

#### 4.12.4 Authority, fees and self-claim

Anyone may submit a proof or a settle and pay the ordinary fee. The recipient
is fixed by the payload, so relaying cannot redirect funds, and a relayed proof
or a third-party settle owes no self-claim fee.

**Self-claim.** A recipient that holds no XOR can claim alone, with no faucet
or sponsor. A transaction is an eligible self-claim when all of the following
hold against the committed parent state (the state the block executes on,
§4.19):

- its instructions are exactly `[Register<Account>(Account::new(authority))?,
  SubmitSccpInboundMessageV1]` or `[SettleSccpV1::Inbound]`; the optional
  self-registration is bare (no metadata, label, UAID or opaque identifiers),
  so an exempt claim carries no other registration effect;
- its authority equals the payload's recipient `AccountId` (the submitted
  payload of a proof, the stored record's payload of a settle);
- the payload amount exceeds `inbound_self_claim_fee`;
- for a settle, the record is `Pending` and settlement can progress: SCCP is
  enabled, the revision settles, it is not held, and `liability(r) ≥ amount`
  (for a reconciled revision, the payout of §4.10 R4 is positive instead).
  Holds that only the release decides (`CreditRefused`, `FeeSinkUnavailable`,
  `BlockLeavesFull`) are not predicted; a settle that meets one and changes
  nothing fails and is charged.

`[Register<Account>(authority)?, AdvanceSccpLightClientV1+,
SubmitSccpInboundMessageV1]` is a self-claim shape too, but it becomes eligible
only once admission verifies the proof against the light client with the
bundled advances applied (`TODO(ws41)`); until then it pays the ordinary fee.

A transaction that is not eligible is never refused for its shape: it pays the
ordinary fee. This covers relayers, third-party settles, amounts at or below
the fee, settles that cannot progress, and claims for a multisig recipient. An
eligible self-claim is fee-exempt on success and charged on failure (§4.19).
Admission pre-verifies it against committed state and rejects it only when it
is invalid: for a proof, the revision accepts proofs, the message is not yet
proven and the proof verifies within the `[zk.sccp]` limits; for a settle, the
record is `Pending`. The queue holds at most one pending exempt self-claim per
authority and per `message_id`, and eligible self-claims count toward the
`SelfClaim` class of the per-block quota.

Only an exempt self-claim makes the self-claim fee due. Execution sets `fee_due
= min(inbound_self_claim_fee, amount − 1)` on the record it proves, or raises
the `fee_due` of the `Pending` record it settles to that value. The fee is
charged once, at release (§4.12.3). A recipient that pays the ordinary fee is
not charged the self-claim fee as well. The existing
`allows_unregistered_authority` rule already admits `Register<Account>(self)`
from an absent authority. A multisig recipient cannot self-claim, but any
funded account can claim for it.

#### 4.12.5 Bounce

If settlement step 2 or 3 bounces, the value returns to the source-chain
sender. A bounce requires `liability(r) ≥ amount` (settlement step 1) and a
free commitment leaf in the executing block; when the block already holds its
512 SCCP leaves the record stays `Pending{BlockLeavesFull}` and a later
`SettleSccpV1::Inbound` bounces it. The target revision `r'` is the route's
`Bidirectional` revision if one exists, was never quarantined, `hold(r', t)` is
false and `liability(r') + amount ≤ max_wrapped_supply(r')`; otherwise `r' =
r`. A quarantined revision is never a bounce target, in any phase (§4.10): if
`r'` would be quarantined, the bounce strands instead (`liability(r) −=
amount`, `stranded(route) += amount`, the record becomes `Stranded`, and
`SccpInboundStranded` is emitted), and only a Parliament `ReleaseStranded`
moves that value. Otherwise set `liability(r) −= amount` and `liability(r') +=
amount`. Record an outbound
message per §4.4 steps 9–14 on `r'` with `amount` = the inbound amount,
`sender` = the escrow account's `AccountAddress` and `recipient` = the inbound
`sender`. The activation, pause, liveness, minimum-amount and cap checks of
§4.4 steps 1–6 are skipped (the cap of `r'` was checked above). The inbound
record becomes `Bounced { bounce_message_id }`. Emit `SccpInboundBounced`. A
bounce that is later voided moves its amount to `stranded(route)` (§4.16).

### 4.13 Inbound light clients

Inbound finality is permissionless light-client state. World state stores
**authenticated validator sets** of each source chain with validity ranges,
plus finalized checkpoints. Each inbound or void proof carries its own finality
evidence, verified against a stored set. The Parliament only initializes,
re-initializes, freezes, installs trusted checkpoints and activates compiled
profile versions (§4.14.3); every advance is permissionless. The finalized
source time of each light client also feeds the destination-progress gate (§4.8
L5).

#### 4.13.1 State

```
sccp_light_clients: SccpNetworkV1 → SccpLightClientV1 {
    params: SccpLightClientParamsV1,   // profile, thresholds, ws_bound_ms, set retention,
                                       // checkpoint stride, per-ISI bounds (no fork bound, §4.13.2)
    head: { latest_set_id: u64, latest_finalized: SccpLcPointV1, last_progress_taira_ms: u64 },
    frozen: Option<SccpLcFreezeReasonV1>,
    state_hash: [u8; 32],              // keccak of canonical state bytes; CAS handle for wallets
}
sccp_light_client_sets:        (SccpNetworkV1, u64 set_id) → SccpLcConsensusSetV1 {
    …, superseded_at_source_ms: Option<u64> }
sccp_light_client_checkpoints: (SccpNetworkV1, u64 source_height) → SccpLcCheckpointV1 {
    block_hash, state_root: Option, receipts_or_tx_root, source_time_ms,
    recorded_at_taira_ms, origin: Advance | Proof | Backfill | Parliament }
sccp_light_client_profiles:    (SccpNetworkV1, u32 version) → SccpLcProfileActivationV1 {
    profile_hash: [u8; 32], activation_height: u64, proposal_id: [u8; 32] }
                                       // append-only; absent = version 1 (§4.13.2)
```

- **Sets** are retained until 180 days after they are superseded.
- **Checkpoints** are written idempotently by every accepted advance, proof and
  backfill.
- **Checkpoint retention.** A checkpoint at source height `s` is kept
  permanently if it is the lowest checkpoint recorded in its stride bucket `⌊s
  / stride⌋` (stride: ETH 8 192, BSC 8 192 blocks; TON keeps none, because
  `OldMcBlocksInfo` covers old blocks), or if it was installed by the
  Parliament. Other checkpoints are pruned 30 days after recording. Permanent
  checkpoints cost a few MB per year per chain at most.

#### 4.13.2 Instructions and weak subjectivity

| Instruction | Permission | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `InitializeLightClient` | Parliament-enacted action only (§4.14.3) | Installs params and a bootstrap set (weak-subjectivity checkpoint). Used when a route is first registered, after a freeze, after staleness and after every Taira reset |
| `AdvanceSccpLightClientV1 { network, expected_state_hash: Option<[u8;32]>, advance: SccpLcAdvanceV1 }` | anyone; ordinary fee. Eligible for exemption on success (charged on failure) as a `KeeperAdvance` from any authority, unless it is a `Backfill`; admission rejects an eligible advance that does not verify or does not move the head (§4.13.4, §4.19) | Stores the next set(s) and checkpoints. Idempotent: re-proving stored data is `Ok` with no change, so concurrent wallets do not fail |
| `AdvanceSccpLightClientV1` with `advance = Backfill { segment }` | anyone; ordinary fee, never exempt | Proof-carrying backwards ancestry: ≤ 256 parent-linked headers ending at a stored checkpoint. Records the segment's first header as a checkpoint (`origin: Backfill`) |
| `ReportSccpLightClientEquivocationV1 { network, a, b }` | anyone; ordinary fee | Two quorum-valid conflicting records (same period/epoch/key block/height, different content) set `frozen`. An advance that conflicts with stored data is rejected with a pointer to this instruction |
| `InstallTrustedCheckpoint` | Parliament-enacted action only (§4.14.3) | Installs a checkpoint at any source height, exempt from the weak-subjectivity bound. It recovers burns that are too old for §4.13.5 (`origin: Parliament`). Refused for TON, whose light client reads no checkpoints (`OldMcBlocksInfo` reaches old blocks) |
| `FreezeLightClient` | Parliament-enacted action only (§4.14.3) | Sets `frozen` without equivocation evidence, for example on a suspected source-chain or verifier compromise |
| `ActivateLightClientProfile` | Parliament-enacted action only (§4.14.3) | Makes a compiled chain-profile version the network's active version from the block after enactment (below). The light client's params, sets and checkpoints are untouched |

**Weak subjectivity.** An advance or a proof is accepted only if its signing
set is fresh: the set is current, or was superseded (by source time) less than
`params.ws_bound_ms` before the Taira block time. Old events are proven by
ancestry from a fresh finality point or from a stored checkpoint, never by
stale keys. A light client whose newest set has aged beyond `ws_bound_ms`
cannot advance and needs re-initialization (§4.13.4).

**Fork bound and profile versions.** The source-chain fork schedule and its
`supported_until` (the last epoch or time the verifier supports) belong to a
compiled chain profile (`iroha_sccp::light_client::profile`), never to
`params`. Each network's profiles are versioned and append-only: version `v` is
the `v`-th compiled profile, a release only ever appends a version, and the
profile hash of a version is the keccak of its canonical policy bytes (every
profile field and the verifier's fixed bounds). Version 1 is active from
genesis. A later version (a new fork, or a later `supported_until`) becomes
active only through a Parliament-enacted `ActivateLightClientProfile { network,
version, profile_hash }` (§4.14.3), which records
`sccp_light_client_profiles[(network, version)]` with `activation_height =
enacting block + 1`; the enacting block itself still runs the previous version.
At Taira height `h` a network's active version is its highest recorded version
with `activation_height ≤ h`, else version 1. Every advance, proof,
equivocation report, bootstrap and usability check executing at `h` runs under
the versions active at `h`. Any advance or proof signed beyond the active
version's `supported_until` fails closed; once an extending version is
activated, the same light client continues with no freeze or re-initialization.

Every block's confidential feature digest binds the active version and profile
hash of every network at its height (version 1's compiled hash when none is
recorded), not the compiled profiles themselves. A release that only appends a
version not yet activated therefore computes the same digest, accepts the same
blocks and replays historical blocks unchanged; mixed releases agree until an
activation. The profile hash covers profile fields and fixed bounds, not
verifier code, so a release that changes what an already-numbered version
accepts must append a new version instead of editing the verifier under the old
number. Height-independent identities (the p2p handshake, genesis signing and
snapshot identities) bind the version-1 hashes rather than the active ones, so
peers at different heights still connect across an activation. Activation is a
release obligation: every validator must run a release that compiles the
version, with exactly the recorded hash, before the enactment height. A release
that does not compile it (or compiles other content under that number) fails
closed and never diverges: enacting the activation, and any later verification
under it, defers the block with `VerifierArtifactsUnavailable`, so that node
applies no further block until it is upgraded, and a snapshot whose state
activates such a version is refused. A version that no release compiles would
therefore stall the chain at its enactment; proposers build the action with
`iroha sccp lc-profile --network N --version V` from a release that compiles
`V`, and reviewers rebuild it with their own release before the vote. Torii
reports each network's active version, hash, activation height and
`supported_until` in `GET /v1/sccp/capabilities` (§6).

#### 4.13.3 Per chain

| Chain | Stored set | Advance | Inbound / void proof | `ws_bound_ms` |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Ethereum | Sync committee per period (current and next), learned **only** from finalized updates. The fork schedule is compiled into the chain profile with `supported_until` (last supported fork epoch), not stored (§4.13.2) | ≤ 16 `LightClientUpdate`s. Each MUST carry a finality branch and satisfy `3·popcount(sync_committee_bits) ≥ 2·512` (≥ 342 participants) and `signature_slot > attested.slot ≥ finalized.slot`. It is verified against the stored committee of `period(signature_slot)`, with the domain fork version of `compute_epoch_at_slot(max(signature_slot, 1) − 1)`, by fast-aggregate BLS. A `next_sync_committee` branch is accepted only when the attested and finalized headers share a period | A finality update under exactly the same rules gives finalized execution block `E`. Ancestry from the event block `B`: `SameBlock` \| `HeaderChain` (≤ 256 parent-linked execution header RLPs from `B` to `E` or to a stored checkpoint) \| `HistoryContract` (EIP-2935 account and storage proof under `E`'s state root, `1 ≤ E−B ≤ 8191`; needs state at `E`). Then the event header RLP (keccak = hash, fields read by index) and the receipt MPT | 14 d |
| BSC | Parlia validator set (address, BLS key) with the epoch-checkpoint height where it took effect, and turn length | **Skipping:** only the set-transition epoch-checkpoint headers. Each carries the new set in `extraData` and is finalized by a fast-finality vote attestation (in a descendant within ≤ 256 headers) signed by at least `⌈2n/3⌉` of the previous stored set. If the set is unchanged, a step from a later epoch checkpoint (which re-announces it) to a header with such a vote advances `latest_finalized` to that checkpoint. Cost is O(set changes) plus one refresh per keeper interval, not O(epochs) | Event header `B` plus a vote attestation finalizing `B` (in a descendant within ≤ 256 headers) signed by the stored set covering `B`, which must be fresh; then the receipt MPT | 5 d (BSC unbonding is 7 d) |
| TON | Validator epoch per key block (config 34, 28, 15) | ≤ 16 key-block hops, each signed by the current subset, with `prev_key_block_seqno` = stored latest key block | Any masterchain block signed by the epoch named by its `prev_key_block_seqno`, or an `OldMcBlocksInfo` back-link from a fresh block. Then the shard registration, a ≤ 32 shard-block `prev_ref` walk (both predecessors after a merge; `before_split` allowed), and the account transaction and out-message | `utime_until + stake_held_for − margin` |

**BSC details.** A stored set is keyed by the height of the epoch checkpoint
that announced it and records the set that finalized that checkpoint. It covers
vote targets from `checkpoint + (n_prev / 2 + 1) · turn_prev` (Parlia switches
after `minerHistoryCheckLen` blocks of the previous set, and checks the votes
on a target against the set of the target's parent). A finality proof is one
attestation `(S → S + 1)`: it names the covering set, and the set's successor
when it is not the newest set, so the target must precede the successor's first
covered height. A superseded set stays fresh until `ws_bound_ms` after its
successor's checkpoint time. The newest set stays fresh until `ws_bound_ms`
after the newest finalized epoch checkpoint that (re-)announces it, which is
`head.latest_finalized`: an advance step moves the head only to such a
checkpoint (a transition's announcing checkpoint, or a later one announcing the
newest set), and finalized blocks without one record checkpoints but never
extend the newest set's freshness. A set the chain no longer announces thus
ages out like a superseded set instead of extending its own freshness with its
own votes, and the keeper's unchanged-set advances start at the latest
finalized epoch checkpoint. A roster's BLS keys are validated once, when its
set is learned (bootstrap or transition); stored sets and the announcements
compared with them are only checked structurally, so no verification spends
unmetered key validation. A transition step starts at the announcing checkpoint
and must be attested by the newest set before the new set takes over. Any other
epoch checkpoint above the newest set's checkpoint, in an advance, proof or
evidence record, must announce the newest set, so every transition is learned
in order. The bootstrap carries the trusted checkpoint and the checkpoint one
epoch earlier, whose set size and turn length fix the new set's first covered
height. Proofs name sets from `GET /v1/sccp/light-clients/{network}/sets`.

**TON details.** A stored epoch is keyed by its key block's seqno and holds
config 34 (with the config-28 shuffle flag) and config 15 `stake_held_for`,
read from a proof of the key block's state rooted at its `state_update` new
hash. A masterchain block is verified under the stored epoch its
`prev_key_block_seqno` names: the masterchain subset for the block's catchain
session (the first `main` validators, shuffled when config 28 says so) must
carry the block's `validator_list_hash_short`, and signatures of more than two
thirds of the subset weight must verify (ordinary or Simplex transcripts). An
epoch is fresh until `(utime_until + stake_held_for) · 1000 − 1 h` (TON light
clients store `ws_bound_ms = 0`). A hop's key block must name the newest epoch;
re-proving a stored hop is a no-op. A proof walks from the shard block the
anchoring masterchain block registers for the minter's shard down to the event
block (`TON_MAX_SHARD_LINKS = 32`), and the event block's proof must reach the
minter's transaction, whose cell may be pruned there and is then supplied in
full. Header, shard-link and transaction proofs may prune the block's
`state_update` (as liteservers serve them); only bootstraps, key-block hops and
back-links open it. A liteserver shard-link proof is rooted at the block before
the link, so builders take a shard block's header proof from the next link and
the event block's from its transaction proof. The normalized sender is codec 7
(`int32 0 ‖ account`), and a transfer's payload must carry the event's amount,
nonce and sender. A Simplex transcript signs the `session_id` it carries; the
candidate data binds the block id and the header fixes the subset, so another
session's votes could only finalize the same block (`TODO(WP13)`: binding
`session_id` to the epoch needs the config-29 options hash and the vertical
seqno of the epoch's state, which the stored epoch lacks). TON records no
checkpoints and refuses `InstallTrustedCheckpoint`. Recorded mainnet answers
(`fixtures/sccp/rpc/ton/transport`) replay through the verifier: the config-28
shuffle reproduces the subset hash of real headers, Simplex signatures of a
block and of a key-block hop verify, and the pruned proofs open. The keeper
looks for a new key block once the head is an hour old, backing off while there
is none (§4.13.4).

Approximate advance traffic to stay fresh: Ethereum, one update per sync period
(~27 h, ~25 KB). BSC, one skipping advance per validator-set change (about
daily, ~3 KB) and one re-announcement step per keeper interval (a few headers).
TON, one key-block hop per validator round (~18 h, ~20–60 KB).

**Builders.** The `iroha_sccp_rpc` builders (§8) that the keeper, the CLI and
wallets share step every advance to the light client's
`max_updates_per_advance` and the submitter's byte budget (the keeper's
`max_advance_bytes`, §4.13.4): they keep the longest prefix of updates, steps
or hops that fits, so a light client that is far behind catches up over several
advances. For example, Ethereum updates carrying a committee are about 25 KB,
so about nine fit in 256 KiB. Evidence anchors are chosen as §4.13.5 states. A
burn that is older than a fresh anchor allows is proven from the nearest
retained checkpoint at or above it, with `Backfill` advances submitted first
when that checkpoint is beyond one proof's ancestry bound.

The per-chain checks are stateless functions in `iroha_sccp`: Ethereum in
`ethereum_native.rs` and `ethereum_source.rs`, TON in `ton_native.rs`, and the
Parlia header, roster and vote-attestation primitives in `light_client/bsc.rs`.

Deployment code identity is not proven per transfer: Taira recomputes the EVM
CREATE2 and TON deployment addresses at registration (§4.14.3), and reviewers
verify the deployment before the vote (§4.14.4).

#### 4.13.4 Liveness, keeper and recovery

- **Wallets.** Anyone may advance, and wallets advance as part of a claim.
- **In-node keeper.** An irohad component (`crates/irohad/src/sccp_keeper.rs`;
  config `[sccp.keeper]` and `[sccp.light_client_keeper]`) runs on validator
  nodes and is enabled by default. It signs with a node-local Ed25519
  `keeper_key`, generated on first start in an owner-only directory, with no
  registration and no funding: every transaction it submits is fee-exempt on
  success (§4.19). It has three duties, each polled independently:
  - **Light-client advances.** It reads each light client from local state.
    When `now − head.last_progress_taira_ms ≥ advance_after_ms` (default
    `ws_bound_ms / 4`), or when the light client's finalized source time lags
    the deadline of a retained, ended generation that L5 has not cleared
    (§4.8), it builds proof-carrying advances from its public RPC endpoints
    with the same `iroha_sccp_rpc` builders that wallets use (§8) and submits
    them as exempt `KeeperAdvance` transactions. Admission keeps at most one
    pending exempt advance per `(authority, network)`, and the proposer
    includes at most one exempt advance per network per block. It steps each
    advance to `max_advance_bytes` and drops, with a warning, an advance that
    still does not fit. Its submissions are verified like anyone's, so a lying
    endpoint can only cause rejected advances.
  - **Keepalives.** It submits a due `Keepalive` with the stagger of §4.7.4
    (`keepalive = true`).
  - **Watch.** It polls each registered destination's `SccpCertificate` events
    and `sccp_certificate` external messages, and its `SccpCommitteeRotated`,
    `SccpCheckpointed` and `SccpLatched` events. It compares each certificate's
    `X`, block hash and `R` with Taira's anchors and generation records. On a
    mismatch it builds `SubmitSccpForgeryEvidenceV1` straight from the
    published certificate (recompressing EVM's 192-byte `σ`), adds an anchor
    witness from local Kura, and submits it. It alerts at `untilMs − 3 d`.
    Watching is node-local duty, not a consensus rule.

  The keeper is its own supervised task and polls each network independently,
  so a slow, firewalled or hostile endpoint of one chain delays neither block
  production nor the other chains. A poll copies the light client and whether
  it is aged (its newest signing set beyond the weak-subjectivity bound at the
  latest committed block time, the time admission checks advances against) out
  of one short-lived committed state view, and drops the view before any
  network I/O. A frozen or aged light client cannot be advanced, so the keeper
  spends no RPC on it and reports it once (`sccp_keeper_needs_recovery`) until
  a Parliament `InitializeLightClient` re-seeds it (below). A stale light
  client's advance is built on a blocking worker under a wall-clock budget
  (`poll_budget_ms`) shared by all of its requests; a build still running after
  1.25 × that budget counts as a failed poll, and the network starts no other
  poll until it returns. A build that fails on the data it was served
  (malformed, inconsistent or incomplete) moves that network's clients to their
  next endpoints. A network is polled again `poll_interval_ms` later plus up to
  25 % jitter seeded per node and network; each consecutive failed poll (an
  endpoint or build failure, an over-budget build, an oversized advance or a
  refused submission) doubles that wait, up to 64 × `poll_interval_ms`, and a
  poll that needs no RPC or submits an advance resets it.

  A hostile or broken endpoint can cost a node bounded time and memory only
  (§8, `iroha_sccp_rpc` RPC hygiene): every attempt has one wall-clock deadline
  (`request_timeout_ms`) for connecting, sending and reading the whole answer;
  every answer is bounded by its route's byte cap and parsed under JSON value,
  depth and allocation limits derived from that cap (a TON answer by its
  query's cap), and an answer over a limit fails over to the next endpoint. The
  keeper's lists start at an index seeded per node, so validators sharing the
  compiled lists spread over them, and an endpoint that answers a request with
  HTTP 404, an error object or malformed data has its answer returned while the
  next request starts at the next endpoint. Default lists of free public RPC
  endpoints per chain are compiled into the `iroha_config` defaults; an
  operator MAY override them and MAY add per-endpoint secret headers read from
  owner-only files.

  Configuration (user → actual → defaults, file-only, no environment variables;
  every default works without editing):

  ```toml
  [sccp.keeper]
  enabled = true                  # default true for validators
  key_dir = ""                    # default "<kura.store_dir>/sccp/keeper-key" (0700 directory, 0600 file, symlinks refused)
  keepalive = true                # submit due keepalives (§4.7.4)
  keepalive_stagger_ms = 15000    # per canonical committee index
  watch = true                    # watch registered destinations; endpoints as for the light-client keeper

  [sccp.light_client_keeper]
  enabled = true                  # default true
  advance_after_ms = 0            # 0 = ws_bound_ms / 4 of each light client
  poll_interval_ms = 60000        # per-network cadence (+ up to 25 % jitter; doubles per failed poll up to 64 ×)
  request_timeout_ms = 10000      # total per RPC attempt (connect, send, whole answer), then failover
  poll_budget_ms = 120000         # wall-clock budget of one network's poll
  max_advance_bytes = 262144      # advances are stepped to fit; ≤ the on-chain per-ISI bounds

  [sccp.light_client_keeper.endpoints]
  ethereum_execution = []         # empty = the compiled default list
  ethereum_beacon = []            # empty = the compiled default list
  bsc = []                        # empty = the compiled default list
  ton_liteservers = []            # empty = the compiled default liteserver list

  # optional, repeatable: a secret header for one endpoint, read from an owner-only file
  # [[sccp.light_client_keeper.secret_headers]]
  # endpoint = "https://…"
  # header = "x-api-key"
  # value_file = "/path/to/owner-only/file"
  ```

- **Recovery.** If a light client exceeds its bound or is frozen, a
  Parliament-enacted `InitializeLightClient` re-seeds it. The proposal carries
  the complete bootstrap; reviewers and anyone else rebuild and check it
  independently with `iroha sccp light-client bootstrap build|verify` against
  their own endpoints before the Parliament decides. `InstallTrustedCheckpoint`
  recovers burns older than §4.13.5 allows. A Parliament round takes the
  full-track latency (§4.14.5), which fits inside the ETH and BSC `ws_bound_ms`
  but not always inside a TON bootstrap's freshness, so a TON initialization is
  proposed on its own (§4.14.5). Recovery is never immediate; the keeper exists
  so that recovery is rarely needed.
- **Wallet guard.** Torii reports freshness, the weak-subjectivity deadline,
  `supported_until` and claim windows (§6). Wallets refuse to burn on a lane
  whose light client is frozen, has less than 25 % of its weak-subjectivity
  bound left, or is within 7 days of `supported_until` (§7.2).

#### 4.13.5 Claim windows

A proof is recorded permanently once accepted (§4.12.1), so these windows bind
only the **prove** step. Wallets journal raw evidence and submit the proof as
soon as the source block is final.

The table states what the shipped builders (`iroha_sccp_rpc`, used by `iroha
sccp claim` and wallets, §8) build. Each builder tries its anchors in order and
takes the first that works. It anchors at a signing set only while that set
stays fresh for one more hour (`FRESHNESS_MARGIN_MS`), because the submission
lands after the build. `C` is the lowest retained checkpoint at or above the
event block `B` (`GET
/v1/sccp/light-clients/{network}/checkpoints?covering=B`). Checkpoints are
recorded by advances (Ethereum: the finalized block of every period's update;
BSC: each step's first and last header and its newest epoch checkpoint
announcing the newest set, including the epoch checkpoints of set transitions),
by accepted proofs and by backfills. A `Backfill` segment holds 256 headers and
moves a checkpoint 255 blocks down. The builders carry at most 64 of them, and
the claim submits each in its own transaction before the proof.

| Chain | Window of the shipped builders | Beyond it |
|---|---|---|
| Ethereum | 1. Latest finality update `E`, when Taira stores the committee of its signature period: `SameBlock`; `HeaderChain` for `E − B ≤ 8`; `HistoryContract` for `E − B ≤ 8 191` when the endpoint serves the state of `E` (≈ 27 h); `HeaderChain` for `E − B ≤ 256` otherwise. 2. Stored checkpoint `C`, under the same rules (`HistoryContract` at `C` needs an endpoint that serves the state of `C`, usually an archive node). 3. Backfill from `C` down to `C − B ≤ 256`, then `HeaderChain`. In all: `C − B ≤ 16 576`. Advances record a checkpoint in every sync period, so `C − B` stays below about two periods (16 384 blocks) while the light client is advanced through every period | `InstallTrustedCheckpoint` within 16 576 blocks above `B` |
| BSC | 1. A vote attestation within 256 headers of `B`, under the stored set covering it: until 5 d after the set's successor checkpoint (the newest set: 5 d after the newest finalized epoch checkpoint that re-announces it, `head.latest_finalized`). 2. Headers `B ..= C` for `C − B ≤ 255`. 3. Backfill from `C`. In all: `C − B ≤ 16 575` | `InstallTrustedCheckpoint` within 16 575 blocks above `B` |
| TON | 1. The masterchain block `T` that registers the burn's shard block, signed by the epoch its `prev_key_block_seqno` names: while Taira stores that epoch and it is fresh (until `(utime_until + stake_held_for) · 1000 − 1 h`), across later key-block hops. 2. An `OldMcBlocksInfo` back link to `T` from the first block after the newest stored key block. With the light client kept fresh, the window is unlimited while liteservers serve the blocks (archive liteservers for old blocks) | Advance the light client first when `T`'s epoch is newer than the newest stored key block |

#### 4.14.2 Activation states and the effective hold

`Staged` → `Bidirectional` ⇄ `Paused`; `Bidirectional`/`Paused` → `InboundOnly`
→ `Retired`. Every transition except the automatic frozen-void transition is a
Parliament-enacted action (§4.14.3).

**Effective Taira hold** of revision `r` of `network` at block time `t`, with
`fp` the network's active fast pause (§4.14.7):

```
hold(r, t) = activation(r) = Paused
           ∨ (fp.taira ∧ t < fp.until_ms)
           ∨ (¬reconciled(r) ∧ (forgery_held(r) ∨ r.quarantine.is_some()))   // §4.10 R1, R3
           ∨ ¬enabled
```

`reconciled(r)` holds once the reconciliation window of a quarantined `r` has
ended (§4.10 R3). Recording to a quarantined revision stays refused in every
phase (§4.4 step 1).

| State | Record | Inbound proof | Inbound settlement | Void proof | Refund |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `Staged` | no | no | no | no | no |
| `Bidirectional` | yes, unless held | yes | yes, unless held | yes | yes, unless held |
| `Paused` | no | yes | held `Pending` | yes | held `Pending` |
| `InboundOnly` | no | yes | yes, unless held | yes | yes, unless held |
| `Retired` | no | yes (cannot occur, see below) | no | yes (cannot occur) | no |

- At most one revision per route is `Bidirectional` or `Paused`.
  `SwitchRevision` atomically moves the old revision to `InboundOnly` and a
  `Staged` successor to `Bidirectional`.
- `Retired` requires `liability(r) = 0` and no `Pending` inbound record or
  refund for `r`. Zero liability means every recorded message was either burned
  back and released, or voided and refunded, so the destination supply is zero
  (§4.15) and no burn on a retired deployment can exist. Minted messages keep
  status `Recorded` forever, because Taira never observes mints.
- A proven frozen void (§4.16) sets `destination_frozen` and moves `r` from
  `Bidirectional` or `Paused` to `InboundOnly` automatically.
- The hold never writes `activation`. Proofs, voids, inbound proving and
  governance continue while a revision is held.
- The Taira side and the destination side are independent: `Paused` and the
  other legs of `hold` stop Taira from recording and releasing, while
  `destination_paused` and an unexpired fast-pause part stop the destination
  from minting (§4.14.6). A Parliament pause proposal normally carries both
  `SetTairaPaused` and `SetDestinationPaused`; a fast pause sets both parts at
  once (§4.14.7). `RecordSccpMessage` requires both sides to be clear (§4.4).

#### 4.14.3 Governance: the Parliament pipeline

SCCP has exactly one governance authority: the SORA Parliament, with the
pause-only fast pause track of §4.14.7 beside it. Validators and their keys
take no part in any decision. SCCP uses the Parliament pipeline
(`ProposeSccpRouteGovernance`, the SCCP body list of
`parliament_attempt_policy_v1`, the certificate and deterministic block-start
enactment) with its own action payload and a per-subject expected head. Binding
juries use anonymous on-chain ballots per
`specs/parliament_private_ballot_design.md`; there is no Parliament key or
custodian, and SCCP reads no ballot internals.

**Payload.**

```
ProposeSccpRouteGovernance { proposal: SccpGovernanceProposalV1 }
ProposalKind::SccpRouteGovernance(SccpRouteGovernanceProposal { proposal: Box<SccpGovernanceProposalV1> })

SccpGovernanceProposalV1 {
    network_id: NetworkId,                    // MUST equal the live NetworkId
    base_revisions: Vec<(SccpGovernanceSubjectV1, u64)>,   // exactly S(P), sorted: the rev(s) the proposer saw
    actions: Vec<SccpGovernanceActionV1>,     // 1..=16, applied atomically in this order
}

SccpGovernanceActionV1 =
  // subject Route { network }
  | RegisterRoute      { network, revision, deployment, max_wrapped_supply, initial_committee: SccpCommitteePinV1 }
  | ActivateRevision   { network, revision }                  // Staged → Bidirectional

```

`network` is always an external profile. Route registration, the Taira pause
and the destination pause on the full track, light-client recovery and profile
activation, parameters, stranded releases, fast-pause suspension, forgery-hold
releases, quarantine and reconciliation are therefore all Parliament decisions,
and there is no other path to any of them. `FastHold{network}` has no action:
its revision changes only automatically, on fast-pause enactment, renewal and
lift clears (§4.14.7). The light-client lane subject `LightClient{network}`
covers the light client's stored state and its active profile version, so an
activation and a re-initialization of the same light client supersede each
other in enactment order, while activations on different networks never do.

Every action that reads or writes a revision's `activation` is under
`Route{network}`, including `SetTairaPaused`, so the Route head covers every
state the route lifecycle depends on. `RouteControl{network}` covers only
`destination_paused` and `next_control_nonce`, which only
`SetDestinationPaused` and fast-pause enactment write.

Light-client chain data whose native integers can exceed 2^53 − 1 (TON
validator weights, which sum to 2^60, and the TON config and key-block data in
general) is carried in `params`, `bootstrap` and `checkpoint` as opaque bytes
(BoC), never as integer fields, because every Parliament proposal must pass
`first_release_exact_json_u64_invariant_error` (below).

**Pipeline.**

1. **Propose.** `ProposeSccpRouteGovernance` has one proposer rule
   (`ensure_sccp_route_governance_proposer`): the authority is a citizen whose
   bond is at least `gov.citizenship_bond_amount`, or holds
   `CanProposeSccpRouteGovernance`. It is refused with
   `ParliamentBallotUnavailable` while the launch gate's ballot leg is closed
   (§10.2). `network_id` MUST equal the live `NetworkId`, the action count is
   1..=16, every action passes static validation (external network, nonzero
   revision, amount and cap bounds, memo length, bounded bootstrap and
   checkpoint sizes, no `InstallTrustedCheckpoint` for TON, a profile version
   of at least 2 with a nonzero profile hash, a nonzero `window_ms`,
   `duration_ms ≤ 3·MAX_FAST_PAUSE_MS`, and every `RegisterRoute` destination
   word unused in `sccp_destination_words`), every `u64` in the payload (base
   revisions, generations, the parameters, windows and durations, and the
   integer fields of light-client params, bootstraps and checkpoints) is at
   most 2^53 − 1 (the SCCP arm of
   `first_release_exact_json_u64_invariant_error`, which the pipeline applies
   at proposal and at attempt creation), and `base_revisions` lists exactly the
   subjects `S(P)` (below) with their current `rev(s)`. The proposal id is
   `ProposalKind::SccpRouteGovernance(..).fingerprint()` and the record is
   stored as `Proposed`; an identical re-proposal while it is `Proposed` is
   idempotent, and one after it left `Proposed` is refused (the id already
   exists). The full proposal body is in state, so every reviewer can fetch it
   from any Torii (§6). Ordinary fee.
2. **Attempt.** Any account creates the attempt with
   `CreateParliamentGovernanceAttemptV1`: for this kind it is permissionless
   and core-derived (§4.14.5 item 3). It additionally fails unless every
   `rev(s)` still equals `base_revisions` and every `RegisterRoute` destination
   word is still unused (checked next to the payout preflight of attempt
   creation); a proposal that fails this check is stale and can never get
   another attempt, so a new proposal against the current state is needed.
   `parliament_attempt_policy_v1` gives risk tier `Constitutional` and the SCCP
   body list: Rules Committee, Agenda Council, Interest Panel, Review Panel,
   Coordination Council, FMA Committee and Oversight Committee (public
   findings) and the Policy Jury (a binding jury voting by anonymous on-chain
   ballot), plus a Confirmation Jury when a Policy approval is narrow
   (`specs/parliament_private_ballot_design.md` §7–§8). The expected head
   (below) is frozen into the attempt.
3. **Lifecycle.** Future-beacon sortition, invitations (binding-jury members
   register their one-time ballot credentials at seat acceptance),
   deliberation, public findings, the binding ballot (credential root frozen at
   seal, casting opened at block start at the anchor `s0`, signerless
   fee-exempt ballots with public vote, nullifier and post-quantum membership
   proof, public counts, closure) and certification run as for every other
   proposal kind, except that the manager-only transitions are permissionless
   for this kind (§4.14.5 item 3). Lifecycle transitions are applied by the
   block-start pass (§4.7), and the shared keepalive produces their blocks on
   an idle chain.
4. **Enactment.** At the first block start with `t ≥ enact_not_before_ms` (G3,
   §4.7.2), Core recomputes the head. A changed head marks the proposal
   `Superseded`. Otherwise Core calls `sccp::governance::enact(certificate_id,
   effect_hash, s0, proposal)` in the isolated effect transaction of that
   certificate: `certificate_id` is the 32-byte
   `GovernanceCertificateId::derive_v1`, `effect_hash` is the certificate's
   `effect_preimage_hash`, and `s0: GovernanceAnchorV1 { height, position,
   timestamp_ms }` is the casting-open anchor of the approving Policy Jury
   ballot behind the certificate (the height, the opening transition's position
   in that block's pass, and the block's time). A Confirmation Jury ballot,
   outcome evidence and enactment never move it, and a retry attempt has its
   own. SCCP parses no other certificate internals.
   `enact` applies every action in order and increments
   `sccp_governance_revisions[s]` by one for each subject `s` of the proposal,
   inside the same effect transaction. If any action's precondition fails at
   enactment, the effect transaction is dropped, no SCCP state changes, and the
   attempt is recorded `ExecutionFailed`. Core emits `SccpGovernanceEnacted {
   proposal_id, subjects }`.

**After a failed attempt.** A `Rejected` attempt (including one whose binding
ballot ended `NoQuorum`) or an `ExecutionFailed` attempt leaves the proposal
eligible for a retry attempt (sequence + 1, at most 16) on the same id, which
anyone may create while `base_revisions` still match. The same content can
never be proposed again under a new id, because the fingerprint already exists.
A retry repeats the same actions, so after an `ExecutionFailed` caused by
content that has gone stale (for example a bootstrap that is no longer fresh),
the retry fails the same way and a new proposal with new content is needed.
After `Superseded`, or whenever any `rev(s)` has changed, a retry attempt
always fails the `base_revisions` check, and only a new proposal with the
current base revisions (a new id) can proceed.

There is no direct path: no instruction applies an SCCP governance action
outside Parliament enactment, and core rejects every `SetParameter` that
targets SCCP state (SCCP parameters are not in the generic `Parameter` set,
§4.1), whatever the executor.

**Expected head, scoped per subject.** Each action has exactly one subject (the
comment above it). For a proposal `P`, let `S(P)` be the sorted, deduplicated
list of its actions' subjects and `rev(s) = sccp_governance_revisions[s]` (0
when absent). The attempt's expected head, which equals the head implied by
`base_revisions` because attempt creation checks them, is:

```
subject_id = GOVERNANCE_SUBJECT_ID_V1 hash of GovernanceSubjectPreimageV1::Sccp(S(P))
version    = 1 + Σ_{s ∈ S(P)} rev(s)                         // checked u64
head_root  = parliament_governance_head_root_v1(&[(s, rev(s)) for s in S(P)])
expected   = GovernanceExpectedHeadV1::Present { subject_id, version, head_root }
```

Only the enactment of an SCCP proposal changes the `rev(s)` of a full-track
subject; the only automatic head change is `rev(FastHold{n})` (§4.14.7). Other
automatic SCCP state changes (records, releases, liability, nonces, frozen
voids, light-client advances, generations, forgery evidence, fast-pause leaves)
never touch a head; each action re-checks its own preconditions at enactment
instead, and the actions that such automatic changes can race have "ensure"
semantics or name the exact state they act on (`SetTairaPaused`,
`SetDestinationPaused`, below). Consequences:

- Proposals whose subject sets are disjoint never supersede each other:
  registering the TON route, re-initializing the Ethereum light client and
  changing parameters can all be in flight at once. Disjoint proposals can
  still interact only through automatic state changes and through the global
  destination-word index, which attempt creation and enactment re-check.
- Two proposals that share a subject are ordered by enactment; the later one
  becomes `Superseded` (or its attempt cannot be created) and must be proposed
  again against the new state. Proposers therefore batch related actions on one
  subject into one proposal.
- A proposal MAY span subjects (for example `RegisterRoute`,
  `InitializeLightClient` and `ActivateRevision` for one network, or a pause of
  every route before a Taira reset); it then competes with every proposal
  touching any of them. A pause (`SetTairaPaused` plus `SetDestinationPaused`)
  spans `Route{n}` and `RouteControl{n}`, so it and a concurrent lifecycle
  proposal on the same route supersede each other in enactment order, which is
  intended because both change the route's activation; neither can end
  `ExecutionFailed` because of the other.
- A captured fast pause panel changes only `rev(FastHold{n})`, never
  `rev(Route{n})`, `rev(RouteControl{n})`, `rev(LightClient{n})` or
  `rev(ForgeryHold{n})`, so it cannot supersede a full-track proposal,
  including a profile activation or a quarantine. Fast-pause leaves consume
  `next_control_nonce(r)`, an automatic change that the "ensure" semantics
  already tolerate.

**Implementation notes:**

- The SCCP arm of `governed_subject_id_v1` and of `GovernanceSubjectPreimageV1`
  (`crates/iroha_data_model/src/governance/types.rs`) is
  `Sccp(Vec<SccpGovernanceSubjectV1>)`, and the SCCP arm of
  `parliament_expected_head_v1`
  (`crates/iroha_core/src/smartcontracts/isi/world.rs`) computes the head
  above. The reducer checks only subject-id equality and head validity, and
  there is no global per-subject lock. A `version ≥ 1` with a nonzero
  `head_root` satisfies the head validity check.
- `sccp_governance_revisions` is incremented inside the effect transaction: the
  failure path re-checks that the head is unchanged before recording
  `ExecutionFailed`.
- State snapshots persist `sccp_governance_revisions`,
  `sccp_light_client_profiles` and every SCCP map of this revision.
- The `base_revisions` and destination-word checks run next to the payout
  preflight of `CreateParliamentGovernanceAttemptV1`.
- Certificates due in the same pass execute in a deterministic order (§4.7.2),
  so overlapping subjects supersede deterministically.

**Action rules** (all checked on Taira at enactment, at the enacting block's
time `T`):

- `RegisterRoute` → `Staged`:
  - **P0.** The launch gate of §10.2 is open, which includes reconciliation
    (§4.10).
  - **P1.** `initial_committee.generation` is retained; `committee_root` and
    `start_height` match its record; `until_ms = deadline_ms(generation)`; and
    every member of every generation from it to the current one resolved (no
    `None`, G6).
  - **P2.** For every generation `g` with `initial_committee.generation ≤ g ≤
    current`: `deadline_ms(g) ≥ T + committee_heartbeat_ms +
    SCCP_PIN_MARGIN_MS`. A destination installs each of these generations in
    turn and freezes if any has expired, so after a validity reduction checking
    only the pin is not enough. The parameter rule `committee_validity_ms ≥
    fast_pause_hold_ms + 2·committee_heartbeat_ms + 1 d` (§4.1) keeps P2
    satisfiable for a proposal that pins the generation current when it is
    made.
  - **P3 (TON).** `master_account` equals the address Taira computes from
    `StateInit{code: minter_code, data: canonical_initial_data}`, with the
    canonical initial data built per §5.3.1 from the generation's keys, the
    pin, the live `NetworkId`, `I`, the revision, the cap and the wallet and
    bucket code refs, using `iroha_sccp::v1::ton_cell` (`minter_account_id`
    over `state_init`, code cells as `CellRef::opaque`; only code hashes and
    depths are needed).
  - **P4 (EVM).** `address` equals `keccak256(0xff ‖ SCCP_EVM_DEPLOYER ‖ 0^32 ‖
    keccak256(SCCP_EVM_CREATION_CODE ‖ abi.encode(ctor)))[12..32]` with `ctor =
    (TAIRA_NETWORK_ID, I, networkTag(network), revision, max_wrapped_supply,
    pin.generation, pin.committee_root, pin.start_height, pin.until_ms)`
    (§5.2.1). `SCCP_EVM_CREATION_CODE` is the exact creation bytecode pinned by
    `scripts/contract_tooling/artifact-lock.json` and embedded in
    `iroha_sccp::v1::constants`; CI fails if the two differ.
  - **P5.** `sccp_forgery_max_generation < initial_committee.generation`, or no
    forgery evidence has been recorded; otherwise the revision would start held
    (§4.10).
  - `revision = latest + 1` for the route; `destination_word` is unused in
    `sccp_destination_words`; `0 < max_wrapped_supply < 2^128`, and for TON `<
    2^96`. `forgery_floor` starts at the pinned generation and `quarantine` at
    `None`.
  - **Why the pin need not be current.** A deployment pinned to a past
    generation `g` is reachable only through genuine handoffs from `g`, and P2
    keeps that path open. A handoff that `g` forges before registration is
    slashable while `g` is liable, and the reviewers' live check (§4.14.4)
    detects it before activation.
- `ActivateRevision`: `r` is `Staged`, no other revision of the route is
  `Bidirectional` or `Paused`, and the network's light client is installed and
  not frozen, so burns on the new deployment are provable.
- `SwitchRevision`: `from` is `Bidirectional` or `Paused`, `to` is `Staged`;
  `from` becomes `InboundOnly` and `to` `Bidirectional` atomically.
- `DeactivateOutbound`: `r` is `Bidirectional` or `Paused`; it becomes
  `InboundOnly`.
- `RetireRevision`: `r` is `InboundOnly`, `liability(r) = 0`, no inbound record
  or refund of `r` is `Pending`, and a quarantined `r` is reconciled (§4.10
  R5).
- `RemoveStaged`: `r` is `Staged` and was never activated; its destination word
  stays reserved.
- `ReleaseStranded`: `amount ≤ stranded(route)`; the recipient is creditable
  under §4.12.3 step 3 and is registered if absent, and the release movement
  accepts the credit; `stranded −= amount`.
- `SetTairaPaused` ("ensure" semantics, addressed by network because at most
  one revision per route is `Bidirectional` or `Paused`): with `paused = true`,
  a `Bidirectional` revision becomes `Paused`, and if the route has a `Paused`
  revision or none that is `Bidirectional` or `Paused` (for example after a
  frozen void), nothing changes. With `paused = false`, a `Paused` revision
  becomes `Bidirectional`, otherwise nothing changes, and the lift rule
  (§4.14.7) is applied to the Taira part of the network's active fast pause. It
  never fails at enactment.
- `SetDestinationPaused`: if `r` exists and is not `Retired`, it sets
  `destination_paused(r) = paused`, applies the lift rule (§4.14.7) to `r`'s
  fast-pause part when `paused = false`, and then records a track-1 control
  with the revision's complete pause state (§4.14.6). The nonce is always
  consumed, also when nothing changed. If `r` has been retired or removed since
  the proposal, it is a successful no-op: a retired revision has zero liability
  and a removed one was never activated, so neither can have anything left to
  mint.
- `InitializeLightClient`: with `expected = Absent`, no light client is
  installed; with `expected = Unusable`, the installed one is frozen or has
  aged beyond its `ws_bound_ms`. The bootstrap's signing set MUST be fresh at
  the enactment block time (§4.13.2), so a slow round cannot install a stale
  checkpoint. A healthy light client is never replaced: to change its stored
  parameters, the Parliament freezes it and re-initializes it. A source-chain
  hard fork needs a release that appends a profile version and an
  `ActivateLightClientProfile`, never a re-initialization.
- `InstallTrustedCheckpoint`: the network is not TON (refused statically and at
  enactment); the light client is installed; the checkpoint is written with
  `origin: Parliament` and MUST NOT conflict with a stored checkpoint at the
  same height (a conflict fails the action; equivocation is reported with
  `ReportSccpLightClientEquivocationV1`).
- `FreezeLightClient`: sets `frozen`.
- `ActivateLightClientProfile`: `version` exceeds the network's newest recorded
  version (1 when none is), so activations are monotone and a version is never
  re-activated or rolled back; the enacting release compiles `version` with
  exactly `profile_hash`, else the action fails (a different hash) or, when the
  release does not compile `version` at all, the node defers the block instead
  of recording what it cannot verify (§4.13.2). It writes
  `sccp_light_client_profiles[(network, version)]` with `activation_height =
  enacting height + 1` and the proposal id. The light client need not be
  installed; frozen or aged light clients keep their state.
- `SetParameters`: `next` satisfies every rule of §4.1, including L1 against
  the node's genesis-pinned staking policy (§4.8). Parameters change only
  through this action, so `base_revisions` already guarantees that they are the
  ones the proposer saw; Torii shows the diff (§6).
- `SetFastPauseSuspended`, the lift rule and confirmation: §4.14.7.
- `AttestSccpDeploymentProgress`, `QuarantineSccpRevision` (which records
  `SccpQuarantineV1 { certificate_id, since_height }` from the enacting
  certificate) and `OpenSccpReconciliation` (which requires `r` quarantined and
  without a reconciliation record, one window per revision): §4.10.

**Replay.** The pipeline enacts a proposal at most once. A retry attempt
(sequence ≤ 16) on the same id is allowed only after a `Rejected`, `Superseded`
or `ExecutionFailed` predecessor, and for SCCP it succeeds only while
`base_revisions` still match (see "After a failed attempt" above), so after
`Superseded` it never does. An `Enacted` proposal can never be proposed or
attempted again. Because `base_revisions` is part of the content, a proposal id
names one decision about one state of its subjects, and a later decision with
the same actions (pause, resume, pause again) has different base revisions and
a new id. Nonces, expiry heights and executed-action sets are not needed.

#### 4.14.4 Deployment verification

Taira itself recomputes every deployment address at enactment (P3, P4), so a
registered address can only hold the locked code with the registered pin.
Before the bodies endorse and the binding jury votes on a `RegisterRoute`, and
again before an `ActivateRevision` is proposed, reviewers (the Review Panel and
FMA Committee members first, and anyone else) run locally:

```
iroha sccp deployment verify --network <p> --address <a> --initial-generation <G>
```

The tool reads generations from the reviewer's own node or cross-checks several
Torii peers, and reads the destination from the reviewer's configured RPC at a
finalized (EVM `finalized` tag) block. It MUST confirm:

- **EVM.** The address equals the P4 recomputation, and the runtime code
  (`eth_getCode`) equals the runtime that `SCCP_EVM_CREATION_CODE` deploys with
  those constructor arguments; its keccak equals `runtime_code_hash`. The views
  return `opCount() = 0`, `totalSupply() = 0`, `controlNonce() = 0`,
  `pauseState() = (false, 0, 0, false)` and `equivocated() = false`, and
  `committeeState()` names generation `G` or a later genuine Taira generation
  (`cur.generation ≥ G`, `cur.root` equal to Taira's record of that
  generation), and every sampled `checkpointHeader` equals `keccak256` of
  Taira's genuine `X` at that height.
- **TON.** The account is active with the minter code, and `get_sccp_state`
  reports `initialized`, not `equivocated`, a zero op count, zero supply, a
  zero control nonce and a committee at `G` or a later genuine generation.

The proposal's Torii view (§6) shows the recomputed checks that Taira will
repeat at enactment. With a genuine pin, nothing can be minted, voided or
burned before registration without genuine certificates, and genuine
certificates never carry leaves for an unregistered destination. Anyone can
deploy a destination contract; only the registered deployment matters.

#### 4.14.5 Seating the Parliament on Taira

Without a seated Parliament whose binding ballot is qualified, no route can be
registered (§10.2), and nothing can be activated, paused on the full track or
recovered. `InitializeSccpV1` cannot check this, so the Taira reset tooling and
`scripts/taira_devnet.py` MUST provision all of the following in genesis, the
shared configuration or the reset ceremony, MUST refuse to produce a network
that lacks any of them, and `iroha taira doctor` MUST report each one. Items 3
and 4 are SCCP changes to how SCCP attempts are driven; the rest are not
SCCP-specific, and the recommended `[gov]` profile applies to every Parliament
proposal kind on Taira.

1. **Citizens.** Sortition candidates are exactly the citizens whose recorded
   bond is at least `gov.citizenship_bond_amount`
   (`canonical_parliament_eligible_candidates_v1`, at most 65 536 citizens).
   Genesis MUST, for each of `C` citizens: register the citizen's account
   (`Register<Account>`; `RegisterCitizen` needs an existing account), mint the
   bond plus a fee float, and register the citizen with `RegisterCitizen {
   owner, amount ≥ citizenship_bond_amount }` (registering another owner is
   allowed only in the initial genesis). Invitation responses, endorsements and
   fast-pause actions pay ordinary fees; anonymous ballots are signerless and
   fee-exempt (ballot spec §3.6). Each citizen is a distinct account whose key
   is a runtime secret generated by the reset tooling and handed to a distinct
   live participant; keys are never committed. Anyone can join later with
   `RegisterCitizen`. Citizenship bonds are independent of validator staking:
   SCCP's exit delay and slashing live entirely in the staking module.

   **Sybil cost on Taira.** The Taira faucet pays 25 000 XOR per claim at a
   4-bit proof of work (`[torii.faucet]`) against a 10 000 XOR bond, so today
   anyone can create funded citizens at almost no cost. Such citizens could
   capture bodies or fast pause panels (bounded as in §9.13), or stall
   full-track rounds by accepting seats and staying silent. Taira MUST set
   `citizenship_bond_amount` far beyond faucet reach (recommended 1 000 000
   XOR, that is 40 faucet claims) and MUST enable adaptive faucet difficulty
   (`pow_adaptive_claims_per_extra_bit > 0` and `pow_adaptive_max_extra_bits >
   0`), and the doctor checks both. Even then, Taira citizenship is only as
   scarce as test XOR.
2. **Body sizes and body liveness.** Each required body seats `s_b =
   min(size_b, C)` members; a citizen may sit on several bodies.
   - **Public findings.** The seven public-finding bodies run one after
     another. Each needs about six phase advances and `⌈2o/3⌉` endorsements of
     the same result root (`parliament_quorum_seats_v1`), where `o` is the
     number of seats accepted when the body's roster was sealed.
   - **Binding juries** (`specs/parliament_private_ballot_design.md` §3,
     §7–§8). The Policy Jury seals only with at least 3 accepted seats, each
     with a registered credential; fewer is an objective `NoRoster` with a
     sortition retry. It has exactly one ballot: turnout below `max(3, Q)` at
     closure is `NoQuorum`, and a lost credential counts as an absent vote. A
     narrow Policy approval needs a Confirmation Jury drawn from citizens
     outside the sealed Policy Jury.
   - **Config constraints.** `policy_jury_size ≥ 3`;
     `coordination_council_size` set explicitly (its default is 150); the
     ballot parameters `vote_notice_ms`, `casting_window_ms`, the per-block
     ballot budget, the concurrency bound and the admission-stamp difficulty
     are genesis or committed governance policy (ballot spec §3.10).
     `[gov.parliament_timed_ovn]` and `[gov.parliament_tle_key_lifecycle]` are
     retired. The `[gov]` values are part of the consensus execution policy, so
     every validator uses the same ones.

   Taira's current values (Rules 7, Agenda 9, Interest 11, Review 13, Oversight
   7, FMA 5, Policy Jury 25, Coordination and Confirmation unset) with its
   single genesis citizen cannot seat a binding jury. The recommended Taira
   profile:

   | Setting | Taira today | Recommended |
   |---|---|---|
   | genesis citizens `C` | 1 | 16 |
   | `citizenship_bond_amount` | 10 000 | 1 000 000 |
   | `rules_committee_size`, `agenda_council_size`, `interest_panel_size`, `review_panel_size`, `coordination_council_size`, `fma_committee_size`, `oversight_committee_size` | 7, 9, 11, 13, unset (150), 5, 7 | 5 each |
   | `policy_jury_size` | 25 | 9 |
   | `confirmation_jury_size` | unset (1 000) | 7 |
   | `parliament_alternate_size` | 21 | 3 |
   | invitation and public-finding windows | unset (3 600 blocks each) | 300 and 900 blocks today; milliseconds once the governance clock converts them (§4.7.1) |
   | `min_enactment_delay` | 600 | 50 blocks today; `enact_not_before_ms` under the governance clock |
   | binding-ballot windows and budgets | — | set with the ballot's qualification (`TODO:`, §12) |

3. **No clerk for SCCP.** `CreateParliamentGovernanceAttemptV1` and the
   manager-only transitions (`CompleteQualification`,
   `RegisterInitialSortition`, `RegisterSortitionRequest`, `AdvanceBodyPhase`,
   `EscalateRisk`) require `CanManageParliament` for other proposal kinds,
   which for SCCP would let one account outside the Parliament decide which
   proposals ever reach the bodies. For `ProposalKind::SccpRouteGovernance`
   they are permissionless and core-derived:
   `parliament_transition_requires_manager_v1` takes the proposal kind and
   returns false for SCCP, and each transition is valid only with the canonical
   content core derives from state. An attempt exists for exactly the
   `Proposed` SCCP proposal it names, whose `base_revisions` are current;
   `AdvanceBodyPhase` targets only the next phase once its precondition holds;
   `EscalateRisk` targets only the policy-derived tier; sortition registration
   uses only consensus-derived inputs. Where a manager transition carries a
   parameter that core does not derive today, the SCCP variant fixes it to that
   canonical value (`TODO:` enumerate each such field in the
   `SubmitParliamentLifecycleTransitionV1` executor). Ballot casting opens and
   closes at block start with no transition at all. Nobody chooses the SCCP
   agenda, and genesis grants `CanManageParliament` to nobody for SCCP. Other
   proposal kinds keep their manager rule.
4. **Parliament driver (optional).** Due transitions run at block start and the
   shared keepalive (§4.7) produces their blocks on an idle chain, so no driver
   ticks, relays ballots or lands transactions at exact heights. `iroha sccp
   governance drive` remains a convenience from any funded account: it creates
   attempts for `Proposed` SCCP proposals whose `base_revisions` are current,
   oldest first, and submits the permissionless manager-intent transitions as
   soon as they are valid. It reads `GET /v1/sccp/governance/proposals` and,
   per active attempt, `GET /v1/gov/parliament/attempts/{id}/plan`, which Core
   computes over one committed view by trial-applying every permissionless
   transition at the next candidate height; this is advice, not a reservation.
   Anyone may run a driver, several drivers are harmless (a duplicate
   transition fails and pays its fee), and a driver has no discretion: attempt
   creation is permissionless, so a flood of junk proposals cannot hold a
   genuine one back. The doctor MUST report every active SCCP attempt with its
   next due item and the height of its last progress transition, and fail when
   an attempt has due work and the tip is not growing.
5. **Global threshold beacon.** Sortition consumes a finalized beacon pulse at
   an exact future slot, and the fast pause panel draw consumes the NPoS
   epoch-boundary pulse that consensus already requires (§4.14.7). A
   global-beacon key session MUST be installed (`InstallGlobalBeaconKey`, an
   exact `2f + 1` validator-roster lifecycle certificate; the Taira
   public-reset beacon bootstrap), and every validator MUST run its beacon
   partial signer. Every validator-set change needs a new beacon DKG and
   `InstallGlobalBeaconKey` before the next pulse, a consensus prerequisite of
   free validator churn on Taira whether or not SCCP exists; it MUST be
   automated in-node (§12). A missing Parliament pulse is governance-local
   waiting, never a reason to halt block production (ballot spec §9).
6. **No ballot custody.** Validators provide no secret custody, opening or
   tally service for ballots: ordinary block execution verifies ballots and
   derives the counts. There are no Parliament TLE sessions, no TLE custody and
   no release shares, and the daemon's TLE preflight is deleted with them
   (ballot spec §9, §12).
7. **Node-generated credentials.** Item 5 MUST NOT add an operator step to the
   validator path. The beacon partial signer, including its FD200 credential,
   MUST default to key material that the node generates on first start under
   its store directory, owner-only as for the keeper key (§4.13.4), and MUST be
   overridable in `iroha_config`; no environment variables. Until this lands,
   joining a Taira validator requires configuring the beacon credential; that
   is a consensus requirement, not an SCCP one.

Validators provide item 5 as infrastructure. A threshold of them can withhold
or delay pulses (liveness, and with the parent proposer a choice among panel
draws, §4.14.7), but cannot choose members, proposals or outcomes, and cannot
open, read or alter ballots (§9.13).

**Tooling.** Binding-jury members register their credential when they accept a
seat and cast anonymous ballots through the account-free submission path of the
Parliament wallet (ballot spec §6), submitting at least `2·max_clock_drift_ms`
plus inclusion latency before a deadline (§4.3). `scripts/taira_devnet.py`
generates the `C` citizen keys in its owner-only workspace and runs the
citizens' invitation responses, endorsements and ballots itself. Disposable
devnets MAY build irohad with the `test-network-parliament-signers` feature for
the beacon signers; public Taira never does.

**Bring-up.** Once the launch gate is open (§10.2), three proposals seat the
three routes (§4.18): one for ETH and BSC (`RegisterRoute`,
`InitializeLightClient` and `ActivateRevision` each, 6 actions over 4
subjects), one with only the TON `InitializeLightClient`, both proposed at
once, and after the TON light client is installed, one with the TON
`RegisterRoute` and `ActivateRevision`. The TON light client is proposed alone
because a TON bootstrap stays fresh only until `utime_until + stake_held_for −
margin`, 9.1 to 27.3 hours after capture with mainnet values (65 536 s rounds,
32 768 s stake hold), and actions are atomic: a stale TON bootstrap at
enactment would otherwise take its route's registration down with it. A failed
TON initialization is re-proposed with a fresh bootstrap. A bootstrap rule that
accepts a set that was fresh when proposed and then catches up is not adopted,
because it reopens a long-range window of up to the proposal's age.

**Latency.** A full-track round takes the invitation window, the public-finding
bodies one after another (each bounded by its window), the vote notice and
casting window of the binding ballot, a Confirmation Jury ballot when the
approval is narrow, and the enactment delay, plus a sortition retry after a
`NoRoster`. `parliament_sccp_attempt_latency_ms()` reports the configured total
of one such attempt and bounds `fast_pause_hold_ms` (§4.1). Wall-clock time no longer depends on
traffic, because due transitions run at block start and the keepalive produces
their blocks. This is the latency of every full-track decision, including a
Parliament pause; the fast pause track (§4.14.7) covers emergencies.

#### 4.14.6 Destination control messages

```
sccp_control_messages: (SccpNetworkV1, u32 revision, u64 control_nonce) → SccpControlRecordV1 {
    track: u8, parliament_paused: bool, fast_pause_until_ms: u64,
    certificate_id: [u8; 32], effect_hash: [u8; 32],
    height: u64, commitment_index: u32, leaf: [u8; 32],
}
```

`record_control(stx, network, revision, cause: ControlCauseV1 { track,
certificate_id, effect_hash }) -> Result<u64, Error>` records one control in
block `h`. It never writes pause state: the caller writes its own state first
(the Parliament flag, or the fast-pause record), and the leaf captures the
resulting complete state.

1. `control_nonce = next_control_nonce(r)`, then `next_control_nonce(r) += 1`.
2. The leaf (§3.4) has `target = network`, `r`'s destination word,
   `route_revision = r`, `control_nonce`, the cause's `track`, `certificate_id`
   and `effect_hash`, `parliament_paused = destination_paused(r)`, and
   `fast_pause_until_ms = fp.until_ms` if `r ∈ fp.revisions ∧ t(h) <
   fp.until_ms`, else 0.
3. The block MUST have fewer than 512 leaves (otherwise the action fails).
   Allocate `commitment_index` = the number of leaves already recorded in `h`,
   insert `sccp_block_leaves[(h, commitment_index)] = Control { network, r,
   control_nonce }` and the control record, and emit `SccpControlRecorded {
   network, revision, control_nonce, track, parliament_paused,
   fast_pause_until_ms, certificate_id, height, commitment_index }`.

Track-1 controls are recorded by `SetDestinationPaused` (§4.14.3), track-2
controls by fast-pause enactment, one per destination part (§4.14.7). Lapses
and Taira-only changes record nothing. The post-execution hook commits the
control leaf with the block's transfers (§4.5), so the block's `X` covers it.
Anyone then fetches the proof bundle (§6) and calls `applyControl` on the
destination (§5.1.6), which accepts a control only with a nonce above the last
applied one. Only the newest control matters: applying it makes every older one
stale, and it carries the complete state. Controls are recorded whether or not
`enabled` is set, for any non-`Retired` revision, and are never pruned. Taira
cannot observe whether a control was applied; wallets read the destination's
`pauseState()` and apply the newest control themselves before finalizing
(§7.1).

#### 4.14.7 Fast pause track

The fast pause track can only pause. A standing citizen panel, a disjoint
backup panel and a reserve are drawn outside the Parliament attempt reducer;
either panel decides by public, account-signed endorsements; an enacted fast
pause holds the network's Taira part and the destination parts of its live
revisions until it lapses by time.

**State.**

```
sccp_fast_pauses: SccpNetworkV1 → SccpFastPauseV1 {
    certificate_id: [u8; 32], effect_hash: [u8; 32], panel_id: [u8; 32],
    enacted_at: SccpPassPositionV1 { height: u64, position: u32 },   // block-start position (§4.7.2)
    enacted_at_ms: u64 /* e */, until_ms: u64 /* e + fast_pause_hold_ms */,
    taira: bool,                     // Taira part still held; set at every enactment
    revisions: Vec<u32>,             // destination parts still held (sorted)
}
sccp_fast_pause_suspended_until_ms: SccpNetworkV1 → u64
sccp_fast_pause_rounds: (SccpNetworkV1, SccpPanelRoleV1 /* Primary | Backup */) → SccpFastPauseRoundV1
sccp_pause_panel: Option<SccpPausePanelV1>
```

**Effect on Taira.** While `fp.taira ∧ t < fp.until_ms`, every revision of the
network is held (`hold(r, t)`, §4.14.2): a `Bidirectional` revision refuses
`RecordSccpMessage`, and inbound settlement and refunds of every settling
revision, `InboundOnly` included, stay `Pending`. Enactment sets `fp.taira =
true` whatever the activations are at that moment, so the Taira part is
independent of activation: if a Parliament pause is followed by a resume ballot
opening, a fast pause enactment and then the older resume's enactment, the
resume restores `Bidirectional` but cannot release the Taira part, because the
lift rule retains it. `activation` itself is never written; proofs, voids and
inbound proving continue.

**Effect on destinations.** For revision `r`, the destination state that its
leaves carry is `parliament_paused = destination_paused(r)` and
`fast_pause_until_ms = fp.until_ms` if `r ∈ fp.revisions ∧ t < fp.until_ms`,
else 0. The destination's effective pause is `parliamentPaused ∨ now_ms <
fastPauseUntilMs` (§5.1.6).

**Separation.** A fast pause never writes `activation`, `destination_paused`, a
forgery floor or a quarantine. A Parliament action writes fast-pause state only
through the lift rule. A lapse removes only fast-pause state.

**Standing panel.**

```
SccpPausePanelV1 { panel_seq: u64, pulse_id: [u8; 32], seated_height: u64, seated_at_ms: u64,
                   accept_until_ms: u64, term_ends_at_ms: u64,
                   drawn: Vec<AccountId> /* ≤ 3k, draw order: k primary seats, k backup seats, reserve */,
                   accepted: BTreeSet<AccountId>,
                   primary_id: [u8; 32], backup_id: [u8; 32] }
```

- **One panel per chain** serves every network; `k = fast_pause_panel_seats`.
- **When.** A draw happens in step G0 of the block-start pass (§4.7.2) of a
  block `B` that carries the NPoS epoch-boundary global beacon pulse (the pulse
  consensus already requires when `(h + 1) % epoch_length_blocks == 0`,
  `specs/sumeragi.md` "Governed NPoS reconfiguration"), if no panel is seated
  or `t(B) ≥ term_ends_at_ms`. The draw reads that pulse as captured before
  execution, or, where an implementation cannot read it at block start, the
  same pulse as recorded in state for that boundary. It happens only in `B` and
  is never deferred, so a proposer cannot choose a more favourable candidate
  snapshot. It registers no Parliament pulse request and adds no
  consensus-mandatory pulse slot.
- **Term.** Draws use only the epoch-boundary pulse, at the first boundary at
  or after `term_ends_at_ms`. The literal reading of "drawn per epoch", a draw
  at every boundary, is the parameter value `fast_pause_panel_term_ms` = the
  epoch duration. The 7 d default exists because SCCP epochs can be as short as
  1 h and each draw is a fresh chance to seat a captured panel: with the
  default 9/6 panel and an attacker share of 0.2, either panel is captured with
  probability 0.0061 per draw, which is about 53 expected captures a year with
  hourly draws and about 0.32 with weekly draws. This default deviates from the
  literal owner decision and awaits owner confirmation (§13 item 1);
  implementations MUST support both values, and the choice is a parameter
  change, not a code change.
- **Who.** The candidate snapshot is every eligible citizen at the parent
  state, in canonical order: a bond of at least `gov.citizenship_bond_amount`,
  no slash or suspension in force, and an active account. Core draws up to `3k`
  members without replacement with the existing governance draw, seeded with
  `H_iroha("sccp/pause-panel/v1" ‖ network_id ‖ pulse_id ‖ be64(panel_seq))`.
  The first `k` hold the primary seats, the next `k` the backup seats, and the
  rest form the reserve, so the panels are disjoint. `panel_id =
  H_iroha("sccp/pause-panel-id/v1" ‖ be64(panel_seq) ‖ pulse_id ‖ u8 role)`,
  with role 0 for the primary and 1 for the backup. Seating sets
  `accept_until_ms = t(B) + fast_pause_seat_accept_window_ms` and
  `term_ends_at_ms = t(B) + fast_pause_panel_term_ms` and emits
  `SccpPausePanelSeated`. The draw is outside the Parliament attempt reducer,
  so it consumes no sortition sequence, redraw unit or proposal-wide entropy
  budget. Seating freezes and retains no bond: a seat holder whose bond falls
  below the floor, or who is slashed or suspended, only stops counting at the
  next eligibility recheck.
- **Seats and acceptance.** `AcceptSccpPausePanelSeatV1 { panel_seq }` is an
  account-signed transaction from a drawn member, paying the ordinary fee; it
  records acceptance (`SccpPausePanelSeatAccepted`), and an endorsement by a
  seat holder also counts as acceptance. Seat holders are a pure function of
  state and time. Before `accept_until_ms`, primary seat `i` is held by
  `drawn[i]` and backup seat `i` by `drawn[k + i]`. From `accept_until_ms`,
  walk the primary seats, then the backup seats, in order: a seat whose drawn
  holder has not accepted passes to the next reserve member (`drawn[2k..]`, in
  order) who has accepted and is eligible; each reserve member is used once; if
  none is left, the drawn holder keeps the seat. Replacement is lazy and never
  due work. A reserve member's endorsement counts only once that member holds a
  seat.
- **Failure modes.** With fewer than `2k` candidates no new panel is seated,
  the seated one (if any) stays, and `SccpPausePanelUnavailable` is emitted;
  with between `2k` and `3k` the reserve is shorter. If the canonical snapshot
  payload would exceed 8 MiB (the citizen registry is capped at 65 536
  entries), no draw happens, the seated panel stays, and
  `SccpPausePanelUnavailable { reason: SnapshotTooLarge }` is emitted. A
  missing pulse (no boundary reached, or the beacon unavailable) leaves the
  seated panel in place and extends its term; this is a governance-local wait,
  never a block-production halt and never due work.
- **Budget.** The draw is not charged to the shared pass budget (§4.7.2), so it
  can never defer due work and break K2. Its own bound is the snapshot ceiling,
  at most one draw per boundary block, never carried over.

**Endorsements and rounds.**

```
EndorseSccpFastPauseV1 { network_id: NetworkId, network: SccpNetworkV1, panel_id: [u8; 32], head: u64, incident_digest: [u8; 32] }
SccpFastPauseRoundV1 { panel_id, panel_seq, head, opened_at_ms, closes_at_ms,
                       endorsers: BTreeMap<AccountId, (incident_digest, height)>, certify_due: bool }
```

An endorsement is a public, account-signed transaction from a seat holder,
paying the ordinary fee. `head = rev(FastHold{network})` is the endorsement
nonce: it binds the current head, so an endorsement can never be replayed
against a later state. Preconditions, checked at admission and at execution:

1. `network_id` is live, and `network` has a route with at least one revision
   in `{Bidirectional, Paused, InboundOnly}`.
2. `panel_id` names the primary or the backup of the seated panel, and the
   authority holds a seat of that panel and is eligible now.
3. `t ≥ sccp_fast_pause_suspended_until_ms[network]`.
4. There is no active fast pause, or its renewal window is open: the record is
   absent, or `t ≥ fp.until_ms − fast_pause_renew_lead_ms`.
5. `head = rev(FastHold{network})`.
6. `incident_digest ≠ 0`.
7. The authority has not already endorsed that panel's open round.

- **Rounds.** The primary and the backup each keep their own round per network,
  with an immutable `closes_at_ms = opened_at_ms +
  fast_pause_endorse_window_ms`. An endorsement joins the panel's open round if
  that round has the same `panel_id` and `head` and `t < closes_at_ms`;
  otherwise it replaces the round with a fresh one opened at `t`. Expiry is
  lazy and not due work. When the round's endorsers who still hold a seat and
  are eligible reach `quorum(k)`, `certify_due` is set; that is a G2 rank-3
  item due at `t(B)`, so the keepalive becomes due (§4.7.3).
- **Both panels decide.** The first round to reach quorum certifies, and the
  other round of the network ends when the head changes at enactment. Failover
  to the backup is therefore automatic and unconditional: the backup can
  certify whenever the primary has not, with no eligibility or timeout
  condition, and a decline, a blocking minority or a `NoResult` in one panel
  never blocks the other. To disable the brake, a blocking minority (or absent members) must
  exist in both panels. If both rounds of a network certify in one pass, the
  primary's enacts first (G3 order, §4.7.2) and the backup's ends `NoResult` at
  its head recheck.
- **Renewal.** A round that opens while a fast pause is active, within its
  renewal window, is a renewal. Its enactment replaces the record before the
  lapse, so protection has no gap. It adds no power beyond the absence of a
  cooldown, because a panel could re-pause right after the lapse anyway.
- **Event.** `SccpFastPauseEndorsed { network, panel_id, endorser,
  incident_digest, count }`. Every endorsement is public.

**Certification** happens at the next block-start pass as the G2 rank-3
"pause-panel conclusion". It rechecks every condition: `t(B) < closes_at_ms`
(approvals never outlive their window, even across a halt); the round's
`panel_seq` is the seated panel's and `panel_id` names its primary or backup;
the endorsers who still hold a seat and are eligible number at least
`quorum(k)`; `head = rev(FastHold{network})`; the network is not suspended, and
there is no active fast pause unless its renewal window is open; and
precondition 1 still holds. A failed recheck deletes the round and emits
`SccpFastPauseNoResult { reason }`. Otherwise Core builds:

```
SccpFastPauseCertificateV1 { network_id, network, panel_id, panel_role: Primary | Backup, panel_seq, head,
    endorsement_root /* H_iroha over sorted (account, incident_digest, height) of eligible seat-holding endorsers */,
    endorsement_count, quorum, incident_root, effect_preimage_hash, certified_at_height, certified_at_ms }
effect_preimage_hash = fingerprint(SCCP_FAST_PAUSE_EFFECT_V1, (network_id, network, head))
certificate id       = SccpFastPauseCertificateId::derive_v1   // fingerprint domain SCCP_FAST_PAUSE_CERTIFICATE_ID_V1
```

It is not a `GovernanceCertificateV1`, so that type's Policy Jury requirement
does not apply.

**Enactment** happens in G3 of the same pass, after every Parliament
certificate due in that pass, in its own rollback-isolated transaction. It
rechecks the whole certification list again, because Parliament enactments
earlier in the pass can suspend the network, lift a pause, or slash or suspend
citizens; a failed recheck ends `NoResult`. Then:

- `e = t(B)`, `until_ms = e + fast_pause_hold_ms`, and `enacted_at = (h,
  position of this item in the pass)`;
- `taira = true`;
- the destination parts are every revision whose activation is `Bidirectional`,
  `Paused` or `InboundOnly` (`Staged` revisions have no transfer leaves;
  `Retired` revisions are excluded); for each part, Core writes the record
  first and then records a track-2 control with the complete state (§4.14.6);
- write `sccp_fast_pauses[network]`, replacing an active record on a renewal
  (which replaces `enacted_at`, so the lift rule compares against the newest
  pause);
- bump `rev(FastHold{network})`, delete both rounds of the network, and emit
  `SccpFastPauseEnacted { network, certificate_id, until_ms, renewal }`.

Block-start leaves are few and the cap is 512 leaves per block, so enactment
cannot run out of leaves in a fresh block; if it ever did, it would roll back
and the round would end `NoResult`.

**Lapse.** A fast pause stops holding on Taira as soon as `t ≥ until_ms`, and
on a destination as soon as `now_ms ≥ fastPauseUntilMs`. No transaction, leaf
or block is needed. The first block-start pass with `t ≥ until_ms` deletes the
record and emits `SccpFastPauseLapsed` (step G4); this is neither due work nor
a head change. A lapse never touches Parliament state, forgery holds or
quarantines, so a Parliament pause enacted before, during or after a fast pause
stays in force. A renewal enacted before `until_ms` leaves no gap; relayers
deliver its leaves before the old `until_ms`. A track-2 leaf delivered after
its expiry only consumes its nonce.

**Parliament interaction.**

- **Lift rule** (`specs/parliament_private_ballot_design.md` §11). A Parliament
  resume (`SetDestinationPaused{…, false}` for a destination part,
  `SetTairaPaused{…, false}` for the Taira part) clears the matching part of
  the network's active fast pause `fp` iff `(fp.enacted_at.height,
  fp.enacted_at.position) < (s0.height, s0.position)` lexicographically, where
  `s0` is the casting-open anchor of the approving Policy Jury ballot (§4.14.3
  item 4). The active record is by construction the current head of
  `FastHold(network)`, because every enactment, renewal and clear bumps that
  head, which satisfies the ballot spec's condition that the pause instance is
  the current head.
  Timestamps are not compared: two transitions in one block share a time, but
  not a position. Otherwise the part is retained and `SccpFastPauseRetained` is
  emitted, so a resume decided before an emergency never undoes a later pause.
  A clear bumps `rev(FastHold{network})` and emits `SccpFastPauseCleared {
  reason: Lifted }`; when the last part is cleared, the record is deleted.
- **Confirmation** is simply a Parliament pause (`SetDestinationPaused{…,
  true}` or `SetTairaPaused{…, true}`). It sets the Parliament state and leaves
  the fast part to lapse; because the effective pause is an OR, the target
  stays paused after the lapse. Relayers MUST deliver the confirming track-1
  leaf before `fp.until_ms`, otherwise the destination can mint between the
  lapse and the delivery; that is the only dependence on timely control
  relaying.
- **Suspension.** `SetFastPauseSuspended { network, duration_ms }` (subject
  `FastPauseControl{network}`) writes `sccp_fast_pause_suspended_until_ms =
  t(B) + duration_ms`, where `B` is the enacting block; `0` clears it, and
  `duration_ms ≤ 3·MAX_FAST_PAUSE_MS`. It takes a duration because the
  enactment time is unknown when the ballot is drafted. While `t <
  suspended_until`, endorsements are refused, and certification and enactment,
  renewals included, end `NoResult`. It does not clear an active fast pause; a
  lift does.
- **Responding to a captured panel.** Suspend first, then resume: a resume
  ballot that opens after the suspension's enactment has an `s0` later than
  every pause the panel could still enact.

**Abuse bounds and parameter choice.**

- **Power.** A panel can only pause. A captured panel can hold a network's
  Taira part and live revisions for `fast_pause_hold_ms` per enactment and
  renew continuously while it is seated, because there is no cooldown (a
  cooldown would let an attacker who forces a lapse disable the honest brake).
  The Parliament bounds this with suspension and a lift. A panel can never
  resume, mint, rotate, release, attest, quarantine or change any other state.
  Value is delayed, never lost.
- **Capture per draw** (at least `q` attacker seats in a panel; `a` is the
  attacker's share of the eligible snapshot, binomial approximation of a large
  snapshot; "either" is the relevant figure because either panel decides):

  | Panel `k`/`q` | `a` = 0.10: one / either | `a` = 0.20: one / either | `a` = 1/3: one / either |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | 5/4 | 0.00046 / 0.00092 | 0.0067 / 0.0134 | 0.045 / 0.088 |
  | 7/5 | 0.00018 / 0.00035 | 0.0047 / 0.0093 | 0.045 / 0.088 |
  | **9/6 (default)** | 0.00006 / 0.00013 | 0.0031 / 0.0061 | 0.042 / 0.083 |

- **Blocking per term.** A panel is blocked when at least `k − q + 1` seat
  holders do not endorse; the non-endorsing rate is `a + (1 − a)·u`, where `u`
  is the unavailability of honest seat holders after acceptance. "One" is a
  single deciding panel; "both" is this design, where the brake fails only if
  both panels are blocked:

  | Panel | `a`=0.1, `u`=0 | `a`=0.1, `u`=0.1 | `a`=0.2, `u`=0 | `a`=0.2, `u`=0.1 | `a`=1/3, `u`=0 | `a`=1/3, `u`=0.1 |
  |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
  | 5/4 one / both | 0.082 / 0.007 | 0.242 / 0.059 | 0.263 / 0.069 | 0.430 / 0.185 | 0.539 / 0.291 | 0.663 / 0.440 |
  | 7/5 one / both | 0.026 / 0.001 | 0.131 / 0.017 | 0.148 / 0.022 | 0.308 / 0.095 | 0.429 / 0.184 | 0.580 / 0.337 |
  | **9/6** one / both | 0.008 / 0.000 | 0.073 / 0.005 | 0.086 / 0.007 | 0.226 / 0.051 | 0.350 / 0.122 | 0.517 / 0.268 |

  9/6 is better than 7/5 on both tables, so it is the default.
- **The cost of acceptance.** Replacement draws from members who accept, so an
  attacker who always accepts raises its effective share to `a / (a + (1 −
  a)·p_acc)`, where `p_acc` is the honest acceptance rate: 0.24 at `a = 0.2`
  and `p_acc = 0.8`. That is the price of a brake whose seats are actually
  staffed.
- **Over a year.** At `a = 0.2` with 9/6, weekly draws give a probability of
  about 0.27 of at least one capture a year (about 0.32 expected captures);
  hourly draws make capture near-certain (about 53 expected), which is why the
  default term is 7 d.
- **Grinding.** The epoch-boundary pulse is a unique threshold signature, but
  an `f + 1` beacon coalition that includes the parent proposer can withhold or
  delay boundary pulses and so choose among draws, which is beyond the BFT
  bound. A captured standing panel lasts a full term; the mitigation is
  Parliament suspension.
- **Taira caveat.** On Taira a citizen bond costs CPU-hours of faucet work, so
  these bounds are CPU-hour bounds there. Mainnet MUST price citizenship bonds
  against a `fast_pause_hold_ms` minting delay.
- **Hold lifetime.** `fast_pause_hold_ms ≥ parliament_sccp_attempt_latency_ms()`,
  the latency of one full-track attempt (§4.1; ballot spec §11). It cannot
  guarantee that the full track finishes before expiry, because unbounded
  exact-pulse waits are excluded (ballot spec §9) and a rejected attempt needs
  a retry attempt; renewal before the lapse, which has no cooldown, covers the
  gap while the panel is honest.
- **Rejected alternatives:** per-attempt panels drawn inside the attempt
  reducer (the standing panel avoids every reducer constraint); a re-pause
  cooldown; slashing panelists for unconfirmed pauses, which punishes honest
  panels when the Parliament is merely slow; timeout-based failover during an
  incident, which favours an always-online attacker more than seat acceptance
  does; and draws at every 1 h epoch by default.

### 4.15 Escrow and liability invariants

- **One escrow per route.** It is `sccp_route_escrow_account_id_v1(network_id,
  route_id, "xor")`, derived without the revision and non-signable.
  `InitializeSccpV1` creates it in genesis for all three routes, so it cannot
  be front-run. Core rejects every ordinary `Register<Account>` and
  `Unregister<Account>` of an escrow id, whatever the executor.
- **Core custody guards.** `ensure_not_sccp_escrow_source` and
  `ensure_not_sccp_escrow_destination` in
  `crates/iroha_core/src/smartcontracts/isi/asset.rs` reject every transfer,
  burn, mint or other balance change that touches an escrow, except the SCCP
  effects: credit by `RecordSccpMessage`, and debit by inbound release,
  outbound refund, a Parliament-enacted `ReleaseStranded` and reconciliation
  settlement (§4.10). The guards hold for every escrow in every revision state
  and are enforced in core, not in the upgradable executor. Neither the XOR
  definition owner (burn) nor holders of `CanTransferAssetWithDefinition` can
  move escrow funds.
- **Invariants after every transaction:**
  - `balance(escrow(route)) = Σ_r liability(r) + stranded(route)`;
  - `liability(r) ≤ max_wrapped_supply(r)` (a bounce checks the cap of its
    target revision);
  - on the destination, `supply(r) ≤ liability(r)` while the generations the
    deployment trusts produce no forged certificate. Every mintable message was
    counted into liability when recorded, burns decrease supply before Taira
    releases, and a void and a mint consume the same nonce bit. The destination
    cap (§5.1.4) is defence in depth and never binds under honest operation; a
    forgery is answered by slashing, holds and reconciliation (§4.9–§4.10).
- Tests assert all invariants, including negative tests for a definition-owner
  burn and a permissioned transfer against an escrow. The settlement tests
  (`crates/iroha_core/src/smartcontracts/isi/sccp/settle/tests.rs`) assert the
  balance invariant after every step of release (with and without a self-claim
  fee), bounce (including a full target cap), each hold reason, liability
  shortfall, refund versus strand, `ReleaseStranded`, a frozen void of a full
  512-nonce TON bucket, a void that leaves a multisig sender's refund pending,
  and pseudo-random operation sequences from fixed seeds.
- **Release precheck.** Every escrow release (inbound release, refund,
  `ReleaseStranded`, reconciliation settlement) runs through the same core
  movement path, and settlement first runs a read-only precheck of that path
  that shares its policy gate (`precheck_sccp_escrow_release` in `asset.rs`),
  so a refused credit holds a record instead of failing the proof or void that
  triggered it (§4.12.3).

### 4.16 Outbound voids and refunds

A recorded outbound message that is never minted is recovered by voiding its
nonce on the destination and proving the void to Taira. No refund depends on
Taira observing an absence.

- **On the destination** (§5.1.8), a nonce is voided in one of two ways, and
  either one emits the void event: `voidExpired`, after `deadline_ms`, with the
  same certificate proof as finalization; or `voidFrozen`, over a range of
  nonces, once the destination is frozen (expired or latched). A void sets the
  nonce bit without minting. Mint and void consume the same bit, so exactly one
  of them can ever happen.
- **`SubmitSccpOutboundVoidV1 { network, revision, proof: SccpSourceProofV1
  }`**: anyone may submit it (ordinary fee). The proof uses the network's light
  client (§4.13) and yields a normalized void event `{ emitter = r's
  deployment, first_nonce, count, message_id or zero, kind: Expired | Frozen
  }`: `SccpVoided` logs on ETH and BSC, and `sccp_voided` external-out messages
  on TON.

  The range is bounded per destination before any effect: an `Expired` void
  names exactly one nonce, and a `Frozen` range is `1..=256` nonces on ETH and
  BSC and `1..=512` (one bucket) on TON
  (`iroha_sccp::v1::network::max_void_frozen_range`). For each nonce whose
  record is `Recorded`: if `message_id ≠ 0`, it MUST equal the record's; the
  record becomes `Voided`; a refund is attempted; and `SccpOutboundVoided {
  refund_pending }` reports whether it still waits after that attempt.

  Every escrow release is one FASTPQ transfer transcript, and a transaction
  that exceeds its per-entry FASTPQ source limits is rejected as a whole. A
  void therefore releases value inline for at most `max(1,
  ⌊min(max_transcripts, max_deltas) / 2⌋)` senders of the intrinsic limits
  frozen at block start (8 under the bootstrap profile), in nonce order; the
  half left over covers the transaction's other movements. Only single-key
  senders are released inline: a transcript's bytes grow with the credited
  identity, and the intrinsic byte limits cover sixteen transfers between
  single-key accounts but only one transfer of a large multisig identity, so a
  few multisig senders could push the void past its source capacity, and a
  frozen destination cannot void those nonces again. A multisig sender's
  refund, and every further creditable refund of the range, stays pending for
  `SettleSccpV1::Refund`, which anyone may submit, several per transaction
  within the same limits. Strands and holds move no value and are not limited,
  so a full 512-nonce frozen void still completes in one transaction.

  A `Frozen` void also sets `destination_frozen` and moves `r` to
  `InboundOnly`. A void that changes nothing (every named nonce already left
  `Recorded`, and for `Frozen` the revision is already frozen and drained)
  fails, so a replay is never a silent success.
- **Refund.** A refund proceeds when SCCP is enabled and `hold(r, t)` is false
  (§4.14.2); otherwise it waits in `Pending` for `SettleSccpV1::Refund`. A
  quarantined revision's refunds are Taira-side records and settle in full once
  it is reconciled, while its liability covers them (§4.10 R3–R4). It credits
  the record's `sender` under the rules of §4.12.3 steps 3, 5 and 6,
  registering the account if it is absent:
  - if the sender is the escrow (a bounce) or can never be credited (a
    permanent identity refusal of §4.12.3 step 3), the amount moves to
    `stranded(route)` and the status becomes `Stranded`;
  - if the release movement refuses the credit now (§4.12.3 step 6), the record
    stays `Voided` with its refund pending for `SettleSccpV1::Refund`;
  - otherwise the sender is credited and the status becomes `Refunded`.

  A refund or strand sets `liability(r) −= amount`. No refusal of one nonce
  aborts the other nonces of a void range or the frozen transition. A
  Parliament-enacted `ReleaseStranded` (§4.14.3) is the only way out of
  `stranded`.
- A paused destination keeps `voidExpired` open, so messages that cannot be
  minted while it is paused are refunded after their deadlines.
- **Wallets** refuse to record when the destination's `untilMs` comes before
  the message could be finalized and no later rotation is available, or when
  the newest control for the revision leaves the destination paused (§7.1).

### 4.17 Events

`SccpEvent` (Taira data events):

- **Messages and settlement:** `MessageRecorded`, `BlockCommitted { height,
  root, count, history_size }`, `InboundProven`, `RecipientRegistered`,
  `InboundReleased`, `InboundBounced`, `InboundStranded`,
  `InboundLiabilityShortfall`, `OutboundVoided { refund_pending }`,
  `OutboundRefunded`, `OutboundStranded`, `StrandedReleased`.
- **Finality and generations:** `FinalityDegraded { height, reason }`,
  `CommitteeGenerationCreated { generation, cause, committee_root,
  start_height, deadline_ms }`, `CommitteeResync { generation, committee_root,
  start_height }`, `GenerationMemberUnslashable { generation, index }`,
  `GenerationDestinationCleared { generation, lc }`.
- **Evidence, holds and reconciliation:** `ForgeryEvidenceRecorded {
  evidence_id, generation, height, rule, offenders }`,
  `ForgeryOffenderUnslashable`, `RevisionForgeryHeld`,
  `RevisionForgeryReleased`, `RevisionQuarantined`, `ReconciliationOpened`,
  `ForgedMintProven`, `ReconciliationSettled { network, revision, backing,
  forged_supply }`, `ReconciledClaimSettled { network, revision, message_id,
  amount, payout }`.
- **Fast pause:** `PausePanelSeated`, `PausePanelSeatAccepted`,
  `PausePanelUnavailable { reason }`, `FastPauseEndorsed`, `FastPauseNoResult {
  reason }`, `FastPauseEnacted`, `FastPauseCleared { reason }`,
  `FastPauseRetained`, `FastPauseLapsed`.
- **Light clients:** `LightClientAdvanced`, `LightClientFrozen`,
  `LightClientInitialized`, `TrustedCheckpointInstalled`.
- **Governance and controls:** `RevisionActivationChanged { network, revision,
  from, to }`, `ControlRecorded { network, revision, control_nonce, track,
  parliament_paused, fast_pause_until_ms, certificate_id, height,
  commitment_index }`, `GovernanceEnacted { proposal_id, subjects }`.

Proposal submission, attempts, certificates and enactment outcomes
(`Superseded`, `ExecutionFailed`) are reported by the existing Parliament
governance events; SCCP adds only `GovernanceEnacted` with the subjects it
changed. Deleted: `SubjectCreated`, `AttestationSigned`, `BlockAttested`,
`RosterGenerationCreated`, `RosterDerivationFailed`, `HandoffStalled`,
`BridgeKeySet` and `AttestationFault`.

### 4.18 Taira resets and devnets

- **Identity.** The Taira identity is the `NetworkId` read from state. SCCP
  hashes, `X.network_id`, the instance id `I` and escrow account derivation all
  use it. Nothing about Taira is compiled into Rust or contracts, so
  `scripts/taira_devnet.py` devnets work with the same binaries.
- **Fresh identity per reset.** Genesis `InitializeSccpV1` carries a fresh
  random 32-byte `reset_nonce`, so every reset has a new `NetworkId` (and
  therefore a new `I`). The reset tooling refuses a `NetworkId` or
  `reset_nonce` it has recorded before. A reset that reused a genesis would let
  old certificates verify, so it is forbidden.
- **Before a reset**, the Parliament SHOULD enact one proposal that sets
  `SetDestinationPaused(true)` (and `SetTairaPaused(true)`) for every live
  revision, and anyone applies the controls on the destinations; a fast pause
  can bridge the time until it is enacted. If it is not done, the old
  deployments keep minting what certificates of their current generation cover
  until that generation's deadline (at most `committee_validity_ms`), and then
  freeze. The old deployments are bound to the old identity: their wrapped
  supply is stranded, and their burns are not accepted by the new Taira.
  Validator stake on the old network stays liable under its own rules until
  that network stops. This is accepted for a test network and MUST be stated in
  token metadata and the wallet UI ("Taira test XOR; redeemable only on Taira
  network `<NetworkId>`").
- **Genesis and the reset configuration MUST seed** `InitializeSccpV1`
  (creating generation 1 and the three escrows, and no route) and everything
  the Parliament needs (§4.14.5):
  - in genesis: each citizen's account, bond, fee float and `RegisterCitizen`,
    and optionally a `CanProposeSccpRouteGovernance` grant for the reset
    operator's proposing account (§4.19); no `CanManageParliament` is needed
    for SCCP; validator staking that satisfies L1 (§4.8) through the SCCP
    Kagami profile;
  - in the shared configuration: the recommended `[gov]` profile, the raised
    `citizenship_bond_amount` and the adaptive `[torii.faucet]` difficulty;
  - in the reset ceremony: the global-beacon bootstrap, installed by the
    in-node automation (§4.14.5 items 5 and 7).
- **After a reset:**
  1. Generation 1 is a genuine generation from genesis; the keeper and
     keepalives keep generations current from the first block.
  2. Once the launch gate is open (§10.2), anyone deploys fresh destination
     contracts pinned to a retained generation that satisfies P2 (EVM through
     `SCCP_EVM_DEPLOYER`, TON with its canonical initial data).
  3. A citizen (or the holder of `CanProposeSccpRouteGovernance`) makes the
     bring-up proposals of §4.14.5. Reviewers verify the deployments and
     bootstraps (§4.14.4) while the Parliament deliberates.
  4. The Parliament enacts the proposals and the routes activate.
- **Wallets** pin deployments per `NetworkId` in `[sccp]` client config and
  refuse a destination whose `tairaNetworkId()` or `consensusInstance()`
  differs from Torii's capabilities.

### 4.19 Permissions and fees

| Instruction | Authority | Fee |
|---|---|---|
| `InitializeSccpV1` | genesis block only | — |
| `Keepalive` | any Ed25519 authority, which may be unregistered | exempt when eligible (§4.7.4 K5); a block with a non-due keepalive is `Invalid` (K2) |
| `SubmitSccpForgeryEvidenceV1` | any, which may be unregistered | exempt when eligible (ingress pre-verified and deduplicated, §4.9); a block whose evidence fails at execution is `Invalid` (R-EX) |
| `RecordSccpMessage` | the sender | ordinary |
| `SubmitSccpInboundMessageV1` | any | ordinary; exempt on success as an eligible self-claim (§4.12.4) |
| `SettleSccpV1` | any | ordinary; exempt on success as an eligible inbound self-claim that can progress (§4.12.4) |
| `SubmitSccpOutboundVoidV1` | any | ordinary |
| `AdvanceSccpLightClientV1` | any, which may be unregistered for an exempt advance | ordinary; exempt on success as a `KeeperAdvance` unless it is a `Backfill`, admission-verified to move the head (at most one pending per authority and network, and one per network per block) |
| `ReportSccpLightClientEquivocationV1` | any | ordinary |
| `AcceptSccpPausePanelSeatV1`, `EndorseSccpFastPauseV1` | a drawn panel member or seat holder (§4.14.7) | ordinary |
| `ProveSccpForgedMintV1` | any (§4.10) | ordinary |
| `ProposeSccpRouteGovernance` | a citizen bonded at ≥ `gov.citizenship_bond_amount`, or a holder of `CanProposeSccpRouteGovernance` | ordinary |
| `CreateParliamentGovernanceAttemptV1` and manager-only lifecycle transitions, for SCCP proposals | any; core-derived content only (§4.14.5 item 3) | ordinary |
| Other Parliament lifecycle transitions and ballots | per the Parliament pipeline and the ballot spec | per the Parliament pipeline (anonymous ballots are signerless and fee-exempt) |

**Exempt classes.** `SccpExemptClassV1 = { Keepalive, ForgeryEvidence,
KeeperAdvance { network }, SelfClaim }`. Each block includes at most
`max_exempt_transactions_per_block` exempt SCCP transactions, with the
deterministic quotas `Keepalive` 1, `ForgeryEvidence` 1, `KeeperAdvance` 1 per
external network, and `SelfClaim` the rest. The quotas count included
transactions by content, whatever their outcome. Besides the generic
`Register<Account>(self)` rule that an unregistered self-claim uses (§4.12.4),
unregistered authorities are admitted only for `Keepalive`, `ForgeryEvidence`
and `KeeperAdvance`.

**Eligibility.** Whether a transaction is SCCP fee-exempt is one predicate per
exempt kind: a pure function of the committed parent state (the state the next
block executes on), the authority and the signed payload. Queue admission, fee
quoting, the per-block quotas and execution all evaluate this predicate against
the same parent state, never against writes of the executing block. So a
transaction is admitted, quoted, counted and executed as exempt exactly when it
is eligible. A transaction of an exempt shape that is not eligible is never
refused for its shape: it pays the ordinary fee and does not count toward the
quotas. Admission pre-verifies every eligible transaction and rejects only an
eligible transaction that is invalid.

Fee exemption is "exempt on success, charged on failure": a failed eligible
transaction is charged the ordinary Nexus fee within its signed fee intent,
when that intent covers the fee and the payer can pay it. Otherwise it fails
uncharged and keeps its own rejection reason, because a Nexus fee receipt never
exceeds the signed limits. The failure charge is the Nexus fee only, with no
PipelineGas transfer. Two classes never fail inside a valid block: a non-due
keepalive and failing forgery evidence make their block `Invalid` (K2, R-EX),
so a Byzantine leader cannot use them for free blocks. Pending limits
are per exempt kind, never across kinds: one keepalive per authority (the queue
also drops keepalives that a newer tip makes not due), forgery evidence
deduplicated by `(g, m, signers)` and against recorded offences (§4.9), one
keeper advance per authority and network, and one self-claim per authority and
per `message_id` (§4.12.4). Ingress MUST rate-limit unverifiable advances per
peer connection. Every SCCP instruction routes to the universal dataspace.

The only SCCP permission token is `CanProposeSccpRouteGovernance`, which only
allows proposing. Its grant and revoke rule is `OnlyGenesis`, as for
`CanManageKagemushaReserve` (`INITIAL_GENESIS_ONLY_PERMISSION_NAMES` in
`crates/iroha_core/src/executor.rs`): genesis MAY grant it (for example to the
reset operator's proposing account), and after genesis nobody can grant or
revoke it. No manager role grants or revokes it. A holder can only put
proposals before the Parliament and pay their fees; bonded citizens can always
propose. The default executor gets allow-visitors for the SCCP instructions;
core enforces every SCCP rule. Implicit account registrations (a recipient at
settlement, refund or stranded release, §4.12.3) have the effect and
validation-fee DS classification of `Register<Account>`.

## 5. Destination contracts

### 5.1 Common semantics (all three chains)

#### 5.1.1 State

- **Immutable:** `tairaNetworkId`; `consensusInstance` (Taira's `I`); network
  tag, domain and identity word; `routeRevision`; `maxWrappedSupply` (token
  units = Taira units); route id; the initial pin `(generation, committee_root,
  start_height, until_ms)`. Constants: `MAX_VALIDITY_MS`, `MAX_FAST_PAUSE_MS`
  and `MAX_INIT_SLACK_MS` (§3.9).
- **Committee state:** `cur = { root: bytes32, generation: u64, start: u64,
  high: u64, untilMs: u64 }`. TON also stores the current keys. There are **no
  records of past generations**, so TON state size is constant in the number of
  rotations.
- **Checkpoints:** `checkpoint[h] → checkpoint_id = keccak256(X)`: every height
  on EVM, three slots on TON (§5.1.3).
- **Latch:** `equivocated: bool`.
- **Pause state:** `parliamentPaused: bool`, `fastPauseUntilMs: u64`,
  `controlNonce: u64` (the nonce of the last applied control, 0 initially).
- **Counters:** the consumed set over outbound nonces; outbound source nonces;
  token supply; and `opCount`, which is monotone and counts finalizations,
  voids, burns and applied controls, but not checkpoints or rotations.
- **Initial values** from the pin: `cur = {root, generation, start =
  pin.start_height, high = pin.start_height − 1, untilMs = pin.until_ms}`, no
  checkpoints, `equivocated = false`, pause state `{false, 0, 0}`.
- There is no owner, guardian, admin key or privileged control key. The only
  inputs that change the pause state are Taira control leaves under a genuine
  certificate (§5.1.6).

#### 5.1.2 Committee state machine

**Definitions.**

- `Live ⇔ ¬equivocated ∧ now_ms ≤ cur.untilMs`; `Frozen ⇔ ¬Live`. Frozen is
  permanent: nothing extends an expired `untilMs`, and the latch never clears.
- `t_eff(X) = min(X.timestamp_ms, now_ms)`.
- **CUR** ⇔ `X.generation = cur.generation ∧ X.committee_root = cur.root`.
  Every other certificate is refused with `CommitteeNotAccepted` before any
  signature check; it never changes state and never latches, whether genuine or
  not.

**Violation predicates.** They are evaluated only on a CUR certificate whose
signature verified, and each is a conflict signed by `cur` itself:

| # | Predicate | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| V1 | `checkpoint[X.height]` exists and `≠ keccak256(X)` | Two different `X` certified at one height |
| V2 | `X.height < cur.start` | Signed before its own tenure |
| V3 | `ROTATION ∧ X.height < cur.high` | A handoff below a height the same generation already certified |

**Latching:** set `equivocated = true` and `cur.untilMs = 0`, emit
`SccpLatched(reason, X.generation, X.height, a, b)`, persist, and stop
processing. Reason codes: V1 → 1 (`a` = stored id, `b` = new id); V2 → 2; V3 →
3 (for codes 2 and 3, `a = X.committee_root` and `b = keccak256(X)`). Latching
MUST NOT revert. When `cur` is a genuine Taira generation, every V1–V3 trigger
involves a certificate Taira never made, and its signers are slashable on Taira
(§4.9): V2 through E1; V1 and V3 through E1, E3 or E4, for whichever of the two
conflicting certificates is not genuine.

**Updates** (`submitCheckpoints`; CUR only; requires `Live`; no violation):

1. Record `checkpoint[X.height] = keccak256(X)` if absent, and emit
   `SccpCheckpointed(height, id)`.
2. `cur.high = max(cur.high, X.height)`.
3. **Rotation** (`X.ROTATION`): set `cur = { X.next_committee_root,
   cur.generation + 1, X.height + 1, X.height, t_eff(X) + X.validity_ms }`. On
   TON, `next_keys` is required iff `X.next_committee_root ≠ cur.root`, and it
   is hashed against the new root (else `BadCommittee`); at a heartbeat the
   stored keys are kept. Emit `SccpCommitteeRotated(generation, root, untilMs,
   start)`. If the destination is no longer `Live` after the rotation (it
   lagged past the successor's deadline), the state persists and processing
   stops without reverting.
4. Nothing else changes `cur.untilMs`: a non-rotation certificate, or the same
   certificate replayed, never extends trust.

**Which entry points may do what.**

| Entry point | Classes accepted | Records checkpoint / raises `high` | Installs successor | On V1–V3 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `submitCheckpoints` / `sccp_checkpoint` | CUR, `Live` | yes | yes | latch |
| inline `finalizeFromTaira`, `applyControl`, `voidExpired` (and TON equivalents) | CUR, `Live` | yes | no | revert `LatchRequired`; the relayer resubmits through `submitCheckpoints` |
| `*FromCheckpoint` | stored id | no | no | — |

**Properties.**

1. **No false latch.** Genuine certificates of `g` carry `X.generation = g` and
   heights in `[start_g, end_g]`; Taira certifies one `X` per height, so
   genuine checkpoints never conflict; `ROTATION` occurs exactly at `end_g`,
   and `high` only grows from CUR certificates at or below `end_g`. So V1–V3
   never fire in honest operation, and genuine certificates of other
   generations (including K→K′→K returns and heartbeats with identical keys)
   are refused without effect.
2. **Anchored expiry.** `cur.untilMs` changes only when a CUR rotation installs
   a successor, at `t_eff(X_rot) + X_rot.validity_ms ≤ deadline_ms(successor)`.
   Identical, stale, replayed and future-dated certificates leave it unchanged.
   Trust in any generation ends by its deadline, at most `MAX_VALIDITY_MS`
   after its certified start.
3. **Retired quorums.** Once a destination installs `g + 1`, nothing signed by
   `g` has any effect on it. A departed quorum of `g` can act only on a
   destination still at `g`, only until `deadline_ms(g)` by that destination's
   clock, and only by signing certificates that are slashable on Taira while
   `g` is liable (§4.8).
4. **Departed-quorum attacks on a destination still at `g`:**
   - forged certificates of `g` at `H > end_g` (E1) are accepted and
     checkpointed and raise `high`; the genuine handoff `X_{end_g}` then trips
     V3 and latches;
   - a forged `X` at an in-tenure height (E3 or E4): V1 fires when the genuine
     `X` of that height is or becomes stored; otherwise the damage is bounded
     by the supply cap and `deadline_ms(g)`;
   - a forged rotation (E1, E3 or E4) installs an attacker generation, and the
     destination is captured: it no longer accepts Taira's genuine
     certificates, so neither controls nor voids reach it. Detection is
     off-chain (the keeper watch, `iroha sccp monitor`, the destination's own
     events and the full certificates it publishes, §5.1.3). The response is
     slashing of every signer, the per-revision forgery hold, and quarantine
     with reconciliation (§4.9–§4.10). Damage is bounded by the cap, and
     Taira-side release of every revision that can be at the forged generation
     stops once the evidence is recorded.
5. **No skipping.** One rotation per generation, in order: at most 16 per EVM
   call and one per TON message.
6. `voidFrozen` is allowed iff `Frozen`, which includes the latch.

#### 5.1.3 Certificate verification and checkpoints

`VerifyCertificate(cert)` runs these checks in order, cheapest first:

1. Exact lengths: `QC_FIXED` 117, `X` 221, signature 192 (EVM) or 96 (TON). EVM
   also checks `committee = 48n` with `n ∈ {4, 7, …, 31}` and `signerYs = 48q`.
2. Parse `X` (X1–X7, §3.6): `X.network_id = tairaNetworkId` and `ACTIVE` is
   set. There is no skew check.
3. Classify (§5.1.2): anything other than CUR gives `CommitteeNotAccepted`.
4. EVM: `keccak256("SCCP/COMMITTEE/V1" ‖ u8 n ‖ committee) = cur.root`.
5. `attest ∈ {0, 1}`; `signers >> n = 0`; `popcount(signers) = q(n)`.
6. EVM: every signer `y` and every `σ` limb is `< p`; `σ ≠ 0^192`; every signer
   key's byte 0 satisfies `& 0xc0 = 0x80` and `(byte0 & 0x20 ≠ 0) = (y >
   HALF_P)`.
7. `id = keccak256(X)` and `R = SHA-256(RESULT_TAG ‖ X ‖ result_body)`.
8. **Cheap path (MAY):** if `checkpoint[X.height] = id`, skip steps 9–12. Only
   `X` is ever used, and it is already certified.
9. `m = SHA-256(P)` (§3.7).
10. Aggregate: EVM uses `G1ADD` over `(x = key with byte0 & 0x1f, y)` and
    checks `apk ≠ O`; TON pushes the key slices.
11. Pairing check (§3.8); failure gives `BadSignature`.
12. **Publish the certificate.** EVM emits `SccpCertificate(X.height,
    X.generation, qc, header, signature)`; TON sends the external message
    `sccp_certificate`. This happens after every successful full-path
    verification, whatever follows (a checkpoint, a rotation, a latch or a
    use). A call that later reverts discards the event with every other effect,
    so a forged certificate that took effect is always published.
13. Evaluate V1–V3, then the entry point's action (§5.1.2).

Step 12 exists because forged certificates can arrive through internal calls
(there is no direct-caller rule), and their bytes would otherwise be reachable
only through tracing APIs that public RPC usually lacks. Other events carry
only `keccak256(X)`, and only the first forged rotation, which a Taira
generation signs, is slashable (later attacker generations give
`EvidenceUnknownGeneration`), so that certificate must be recoverable. The
keeper watch builds evidence straight from these events (§4.13.4). The cost is
about 8k gas per full-path certificate on EVM.

**Checkpoints.**

- **EVM:** `mapping(uint64 ⇒ bytes32) checkpointHeader`, never evicted.
- **TON:** at most 3 entries `(height, id)`. Insert only if the height is
  absent and either `count < 3` or `height > min stored`; the minimum is
  evicted. A height already present with an equal id is a no-op. Conflict
  detection covers retained entries only.
- **Using a checkpoint** (`CheckpointRefV1 = {header: X}`): require
  `checkpoint[X.height] = keccak256(X) ≠ 0` (else `UnknownCheckpoint`), X1–X7
  with `ACTIVE`, and `Live`. The generation that signed it need not still be
  current: the checkpoint was verified while that generation was trusted, and
  the latch and the freeze still block use.
- **TON eviction race.** A `*_checkpoint` message whose checkpoint was evicted
  throws `UnknownCheckpoint` and bounces with its value; the inline form is
  always available as the fallback.

**`submitCheckpoints(certs[1..16])`** (TON: one `sccp_checkpoint` per message)
is permissionless, works while paused and does not count toward `opCount`. Like
every entry point, it first checks chain identity (EVM `block.chainid` of the
profile; TON `GLOBALID = −239`). It processes certificates in order (§5.1.2
updates). A latch, or a rotation that leaves the destination not `Live`,
persists and stops processing. Any other failure reverts the whole call: the
batch is atomic. It reverts `NothingToDo` iff no state changed, and
`TooManyCertificates` with more than 16 certificates.

#### 5.1.4 Supply cap

`maxWrappedSupply` is immutable and is set at construction to Taira's
`max_wrapped_supply` (same units). Mint reverts if it would be exceeded.

#### 5.1.5 Block and message proofs, and finalization

`BlockRefV1 = {height, sccpRoot, messageCount, historyIndex, historyPath}` is
checked against a verified `X`:

- If `height = X.height`: require `sccpRoot = X.sccp_root ≠ 0`, `messageCount =
  X.message_count`, `historyIndex = 0` and an empty path.
- Otherwise: require `height < X.height`, `1 ≤ messageCount ≤ 512`, `sccpRoot ≠
  0` and `len(historyPath) ≤ 32`, and `merkle_root(history_leaf(height,
  sccpRoot, messageCount), historyIndex, X.history_size, historyPath) =
  X.history_root` (§3.5). `X.history_size ≤ 2^32` is part of X5, so a
  one-sibling path for leaf `2^32` can never verify.

Leaves are checked with `merkle_root(leaf, leafIndex, messageCount, path) =
sccpRoot` (path ≤ 9 siblings). Any certificate of the current generation, or
any stored checkpoint, therefore proves any older message or control.

**`finalizeFromTaira(cert, proof)` / `finalizeFromCheckpoint(ref, proof)`:**

1. Chain identity: EVM `block.chainid` of the profile; TON `GLOBALID = −239`.
2. Obtain `X`: inline, `VerifyCertificate` as CUR (which records the checkpoint
   and raises `high`); otherwise the checkpoint use check.
3. Require `Live` and no effective pause (`MintingIsPaused`, §5.1.6).
4. The block reference, as above. The payload is valid per §3.2 with
   `source_domain 0`; `dest_domain`, `route_revision` and `route_id` equal to
   this contract's own; `asset_id = "xor"`; a recipient valid for the own codec
   (EVM: nonzero and not this contract; TON: `addr_std` workchain 0, not the
   minter); and `now_ms ≤ deadline_ms`.
5. The transfer `leaf` per §3.4 with the own destination word verifies against
   the block reference.
6. The payload's `nonce` is not consumed; mark it consumed.
7. `totalSupply (+ pending) + amount ≤ maxWrappedSupply`.
8. Mint `amount` to the recipient; `opCount += 1`; emit `SccpFinalized`. Return
   the message id.

Finalization is permissionless; the recipient is fixed by the payload.

#### 5.1.6 Parliament and fast-pause controls (`applyControl`)

The pause state of a destination is set only by Taira control leaves (§3.4,
§4.14.6). `ControlProofV1` carries `{controlNonce, track, parliamentPaused,
fastPauseUntilMs, certificateId, effectHash, leafIndex, path, block}`.

1. Chain identity, as in §5.1.5.
2. Obtain `X` (inline as CUR, or from a checkpoint) and require `Live`.
3. The leaf is the §3.4 control leaf computed from the contract's own
   immutables (`lane_bytes(sora-taira, own network)` with the own
   `tairaNetworkId`, the own destination word, the own `routeRevision`) and the
   supplied fields; it verifies against the block reference. The §3.4
   constraints hold, else `BadControl`.
4. `controlNonce > stored`, else `StaleControl`. Gaps are allowed: only the
   newest control needs to be applied.
5. Set `parliamentPaused = leaf.parliament_paused` and `fastPauseUntilMs =
   min(leaf.fast_pause_until_ms, now_ms + MAX_FAST_PAUSE_MS)`, store the nonce,
   `opCount += 1`, and emit `SccpControlApplied(controlNonce, track,
   parliamentPaused, fastPauseUntilMs, certificateId)`.

The **effective pause** is `parliamentPaused ∨ now_ms < fastPauseUntilMs`. It
blocks minting only: burns, voids, checkpoints, rotations and controls are
never paused. The clamp is defence in depth against a Byzantine Taira time,
which CT1 already bounds (§4.3). A track-2 leaf applied after its expiry only
consumes its nonce. `applyControl` is permissionless and not blocked by the
pause. It needs `Live`, so a frozen destination cannot apply controls, which is
harmless because it can never mint again. The destination holds no privileged
key at all: the Parliament or the fast pause panel decides, Taira's committee
certifies the block that carries the decision, and any relayer delivers it.

#### 5.1.7 `transferToTaira`

Burns wrapped XOR from the caller and emits the source event:

- **Canonical calldata** (EVM): the contract reverts with
  `NonCanonicalCalldata()` unless `msg.data.length = 4 + 0x80 + ceil32(len)`,
  the offset word of `tairaRecipient` is `0x60`, `len` is in 1..=1024, and the
  padding after the recipient bytes is zero. Solidity's own decoder accepts
  other encodings; this rule keeps exactly one accepted encoding, which the
  shared `calldata_conformance` table pins together with the Rust decoder
  (§5.2.2). A dirty `expectedNonce` word already reverts in Solidity's ABI
  decoder.
- recipient: `taira_account` bytes, 1..=1024.
- `tokenAmount > 0` and `tokenAmount < 2^128` (units are Taira units).
- **EVM:** `nonce = transferNonces[msg.sender]` MUST equal the caller-supplied
  `expectedNonce`, then increments. Per-sender nonces make the payload
  derivable from the call.
- **TON:** the owner MUST be `addr_std` in workchain 0 without anycast.
  Otherwise the minter throws, and the standard bounce restores the wallet
  balance. `nonce = outbound_nonce++` (the Jetton master serializes all burns).
- Build the payload per §3.2 (`dest_domain 0`, `deadline_ms 0`, sender =
  caller, route constants) and `message_id` per §3.3 with lane `(own, Taira)`.
  Burn, `opCount += 1`, emit.

Burns are allowed while paused, after expiry and after a latch.

#### 5.1.8 Voids

- **`voidExpired(nonce, cert, proof)` / `voidExpiredFromCheckpoint(nonce, ref,
  proof)`** run the steps of §5.1.5 except the pause check (step 3's pause
  part) and the cap check (step 7), and require `now_ms > deadline_ms` instead
  of `≤`. They require `Live`. The `nonce` argument MUST equal the payload
  nonce. They mark the nonce consumed, set `opCount += 1` and emit
  `SccpVoided(messageId, nonce)`. Nothing is minted.
- **`voidFrozen(firstNonce, count)`** requires `Frozen` (expired or latched);
  `1 ≤ count ≤ 256` and `firstNonce + count ≤ 2^64` (on TON `≤ 512` within one
  bucket); and every nonce in the range unconsumed, else revert. It marks them
  all consumed, sets `opCount += 1`, and emits `SccpVoided(0, nonce)` per nonce
  (TON: one external-out message for the range). It is permissionless: a frozen
  destination can never mint again, so voiding any nonce is safe. A mint
  already in flight on TON when the latch fires is not minted (§5.3.4).
- **Canonical calldata** (EVM): `voidFrozen` reverts with
  `NonCanonicalCalldata()` unless `msg.data.length = 0x44`. Voids are proven to
  Taira from the `SccpVoided` logs (§4.16), so the dynamic `voidExpired*`
  arguments need no calldata rule.

### 5.2 EVM: Ethereum and BSC (`contracts/evm/sccp/SccpTairaXor.sol`)

One source file is compiled by `solc` 0.8.31 for Ethereum and BSC. The contract
is the ERC-20/BEP-20 token itself. It makes no external calls other than
precompiles (so it needs no reentrancy guard), and has no owner, no upgrade
path and no setters. Token metadata: name `Taira XOR`, symbol `tXOR`, decimals
9, initial supply 0.

#### 5.2.1 Constructor and deployment

```solidity
constructor(bytes32 tairaNetworkId, bytes32 consensusInstance, uint8 networkTag /*0x41|0x42*/,
            uint32 routeRevision /*≠0*/, uint256 maxWrappedSupply /*≠0, <2^128*/,
            uint64 initialGeneration /*≥1*/, bytes32 initialCommitteeRoot /*≠0*/,
            uint64 initialStartHeight /*≥1*/,
            uint64 initialUntilMs /*now < u ≤ now + MAX_VALIDITY_MS + MAX_INIT_SLACK_MS*/)
```

- The constructor derives the domain, identity word and route id text from
  `networkTag`, requires `block.chainid` to equal the identity word, sets `cur
  = {root, generation, start, high = start − 1, untilMs}` and the pause state
  `{false, 0, 0}`, and stores every argument as an immutable, plus
  `MAX_VALIDITY_MS` and `MAX_FAST_PAUSE_MS`.
- **The slack on `initialUntilMs`.** `until_ms = deadline_ms(g)` is anchored at
  Taira's certified time, which can be ahead of a destination's clock by up to
  `2·max_clock_drift_ms` plus the destination's own lag. Without the slack, a
  pin with `validity = MAX_VALIDITY_MS` could fail the bound. The bound is
  defence in depth: Taira checks `until_ms` exactly (§4.14.3 P1).
- **Deterministic deployment.** The contract is created only through
  `SCCP_EVM_DEPLOYER` (the keyless deterministic-deployment proxy at
  `0x4e59b448…956c`, at the same address on Ethereum and BSC), with salt `0^32`
  and init code `SCCP_EVM_CREATION_CODE ‖ abi.encode(constructor arguments)`.
  The address is then a function of the arguments, and Taira recomputes it
  (§4.14.3 P4). `iroha sccp deployment deploy` refuses any other path. A
  front-runner that deploys the same arguments first produces the identical
  contract at the same address. `TODO:` verify that the proxy's runtime code
  hash is identical on Ethereum and BSC, and record it in
  `iroha_sccp::v1::constants`.

Unchanged views: `transferNonces(address)` (`0xf6f0e8a6`), `tairaNetworkId()`
(`0x6b91d731`), `routeRevision()` (`0x1818891a`) and `maxWrappedSupply()`
(`0xd8bc4dcd`), plus the standard ERC-20 surface (`name`, `symbol`, `decimals`,
`totalSupply`, `balanceOf`, `transfer`, `transferFrom`, `approve`, `allowance`,
`Transfer`, `Approval`). Calldata is the standard Solidity ABI encoding of
these signatures. Selectors are the first four bytes of Keccak-256 over the
canonical signature with tuples expanded, for example
`submitCheckpoints((bytes,bytes,bytes,bytes,bytes)[])` → `0x07a5e706`. None
collides with an ERC-20 selector or with another listed one. Removed with the
attestation transport: `finalizeFromTairaHistorical`, `rotateRosters`,
`applyControlHistorical`, `voidExpiredHistorical`, `rosterState`,
`domainSeparator`, `initialRosterDigest`, `initialRosterGeneration` and
`maxRosterValidityMs`, the roster and signature errors (`RosterNotAccepted`,
`BadRoster`, `BadRosterValidity`, `BadSignatures`, `TooFewSignatures`,
`BadRotation`), and, with TRON, the direct-caller rule
(`REQUIRE_DIRECT_CALLER`, `DirectCallerRequired()`).

**Canonical calldata.** `transferToTaira` and `voidFrozen` accept exactly the
encoding Solidity's own encoder produces and revert with
`NonCanonicalCalldata()` (or in Solidity's ABI decoder, with empty revert data)
on every other one: every dynamic offset equals the position where the
canonical encoder puts that value's tail (`0x60` for `tairaRecipient`); every
integer word fits its declared width; the padding after every `bytes` value is
zero; and `msg.data.length` equals the canonical length exactly (`0x44` for
`voidFrozen`). `iroha_sccp::v1::evm_abi` decodes the same set
(`TransferToTairaCallV1`, and `VoidCallV1` restricted to `voidFrozen`, which
also bounds a range to 1..=256 nonces ending at most at `2^64 − 1`), and the
conformance table `calldata_conformance` in
`fixtures/sccp/evm_calldata_v1.json` pins that the contract and the decoder
accept exactly the same entries (§11).

`SccpTransferToTaira` is the inbound source event consumed by Taira (§4.12.2):
`data = abi.encode(uint64 nonce, bytes payload)` and `topics[2] =

ERC-20 `Transfer` from/to `address(0)`. `SccpRosterRotated` is removed.

**Errors.** One shared table maps EVM names to TON exit codes, and the
cross-check harness keys on the names:

`BadBurnPayload` 427, `BucketNotActive` 430 and `NothingToRetry` 431. Code 432
stays unassigned. TON reports an already consumed nonce through the bucket's
`sccp_already_consumed` reply (§5.3.4), not an exit code, so
`AlreadyConsumed` has no TON code.

#### 5.2.4 BLS implementation (EIP-2537)

Ethereum provides EIP-2537 since Pectra and BSC since BEP-439; both price the
precompiles identically.

- **Precompiles:** `G1ADD 0x0b`, `G2ADD 0x0d`, `PAIRING_CHECK 0x0f`,
  `MAP_FP2_TO_G2 0x11`, `SHA256 0x02`, `MODEXP 0x05`.
- **Gas.** Every precompile call MUST forward `gas()`; hard-coded stipends are
  forbidden, because the contract is immutable and repricings happen. Every
  call checks `success`, the return length and the value.
- **Fail fast.** Precompile errors consume all forwarded gas, so step 6 of
  §5.1.3 MUST run before any precompile.
- **Hash to G2.** Vendor Lido `BLS12_381.hashToG2(bytes32)` (MIT; derived from
  Solady and Ithaca; Sigma Prime assessment) as
  `contracts/evm/sccp/lib/BLS12_381.sol`, verbatim except for one documented
  deviation: restore Solady's `calldatacopy(s, calldatasize(), 0x40)` zeroing
  of `Z_pad` immediately after `let s := add(b, 0x100)`. The vendored file
  states the upstream revision and this diff.
- **Pairing input** is 768 bytes, `apk ‖ Q ‖ (−g1) ‖ σ`, and must return 32
  bytes equal to 1.
- **Not used:** BSC's precompile `0x66`. It returns empty on failure, does not
  check key uniqueness, is BSC-specific and removable, and would be a second
  verifier to audit.

#### 5.2.5 Build

The same creation code serves Ethereum and BSC; runtime code differs only in
immutables. Compile with `evmVersion: cancun` (`mcopy`). The build is
reproducible from `scripts/contract_tooling/compiler-lock.json`, and its exact
creation bytes are `SCCP_EVM_CREATION_CODE` (§4.14.3 P4). The EDR harness runs
at Prague or later (BSC: Pascal). Payload parsing reads calldata slices, with
no memory copies of the payload; `transferToTaira` builds the payload in memory
and hashes it once for `payload_hash` and once for `message_id`.

### 5.3 TON (Tolk)

Three contracts: `SccpTairaXorMinter` (TEP-74 Jetton master with the bridge
built in), `SccpTairaXorWallet` (TEP-74 wallet) and `SccpConsumedBucket`
(replay flags). All are in workchain 0.

#### 5.3.1 Minter storage (TL-B) and canonical initial data

```
minter_data#_ initialized:Bool equivocated:Bool total_supply:Coins pending_supply:Coins outbound_nonce:uint64

minter_config#_ taira_network_id:bits256 consensus_instance:bits256 route_revision:uint32 max_supply:Coins

```

- `retries` maps a nonce to a recorded asynchronous step (§5.3.4): `1`
  (`SCCP_RETRY_UNCONSUME`) for an `sccp_unconsume` of that nonce, `2`
  (`SCCP_RETRY_ACTIVATE`) for the activation of bucket `i` under the key `i ·
  512`. Without it, a consumed nonce whose mint never arrived could be neither
  minted nor voided. It is empty in the initial data.
- `get_jetton_data` builds the TEP-64 content (on-chain name `Taira XOR`,
  symbol `tXOR`, decimals `9`) at run time from constants, so no content cell
  is stored.
- **State size is constant.** There is no tenure dictionary. A rotation
  replaces the `KeyChunk` chain (at most 16 cells), or keeps it at a heartbeat;
  `retries` is bounded by the outstanding asynchronous steps.

**Canonical initial data** for a deployment pinned to Taira generation `G`:
`initialized = false`, `equivocated = false`, every counter and supply zero,
`parliament_paused = false`, `fast_pause_until_ms = 0`, `deployed_buckets = 0`,
`checkpoints.count = 0` and `retries` empty; `config` holds the live
`NetworkId`, `I`, the revision, the cap, the pin and the wallet and bucket
code; `committee` holds the pin with the generation's keys and `high = start −
1`. Taira recomputes the minter address from exactly this data at
`RegisterRoute` (§4.14.3 P3), so the stored committee is bound to the pin by
construction.

**`sccp_init`** (permissionless, once) completes deployment. It requires
`initialized = false`, `GLOBALID = −239`, a valid `n` with keys strictly
ascending (`SDLEXCMP`), the keccak committee root of the stored keys equal to
`committee.root = initial.root`, the remaining committee fields equal to
`initial`, and `now_ms < until_ms ≤ now_ms + MAX_VALIDITY_MS +
MAX_INIT_SLACK_MS` (§5.2.1 explains the slack). It then sets `initialized =
true`. Every other operation throws until then.

#### 5.3.2 Cell formats

```
taira_cert#_ signature:bits768 signers:uint32 qc:^QcFixed x:^XHead = TairaCert;
qc_fixed#_ epoch:uint64 epoch_context:bits256 view:uint64 block_hash:bits256 attest:uint8 result_body:bits256 = QcFixed;

hash_chunk#_ hashes:(k × uint256) next:(Maybe ^HashChunk) = HashChunk;   // k = 3 except the last chunk
```

- Every cell taken from a message MUST be an ordinary cell with the exact bit
  and ref counts above; exotic cells are rejected with `BadSnake`. `XHead.bytes
  ‖ XTail.bytes = X`.
- **`SnakeBytes`** is a standard snake cell. All data bits are bytes, and the
  continuation is the single reference when present. A chunk with a
  continuation holds exactly 127 bytes; the last chunk holds 1..=127 bytes;
  there are no empty chunks and no other references. Contracts reject any other
  shape, and golden BoCs pin it (§11).
- **Chunked lists** (`KeyChunk`, `HashChunk`) are maximally packed except the
  last chunk.

To a bucket (sender MUST be the minter; every message is bounceable):

| Op | TL-B |
|---|---|
| `0x53434338` | `sccp_activate_bucket query_id:uint64 index:uint64`, sent with the canonical `StateInit` |
| `0x53434331` | `sccp_consume query_id:uint64 nonce:uint64 amount:uint96 tail:^ConsumeTail` (first 256 body bits = `op ‖ query_id ‖ nonce ‖ amount`) |

| `0x53434335` | `sccp_unconsume nonce:uint64` |

A bucket accepts `sccp_consume`, `sccp_consume_range` and `sccp_unconsume` only
when `activated` (else it throws `BucketNotActive` and the message bounces).
Only `sccp_activate_bucket` from the minter, whose `index` must match, sets
`activated`. Anyone may `top_up` a bucket.

```
consume_tail#_ kind:uint1 recipient:MsgAddress response:MsgAddressInt message_id:uint256 = ConsumeTail;  // kind 0 mint, 1 void

sccp_burn_to_taira#53434254 recipient:^SnakeBytes = SccpBurnToTaira;
```

External-out messages from the minter:

```

sccp_voided#5343564f message_id:uint256 first_nonce:uint64 count:uint16 = ExtOut;   // message_id = 0 for frozen voids

sccp_certificate#53434346 height:uint64 generation:uint64 cert:^TairaCert = ExtOut;   // §5.1.3 step 12
```

`sccp_roster_rotated` is deleted. The new tags collide with no existing op or
event tag. Every external-out message is sent with bounce on action failure
(send mode `+16`): an event that cannot be sent aborts its step's transaction
and bounces the inbound message, so no step completes without its event.

#### 5.3.4 Flows

**Verification binding (pinned).**

1. **Order:** parse, then check the required value (it uses the payload nonce
   and bucket count), then verify, so an underfunded call fails cheaply before
   any signature work.
2. **`m`:** `HASHEXTA` id 0 over byte-aligned builders into an empty builder,
   then `ENDC`, `CTOS`: a slice of exactly 256 bits and no refs.
   `BLS_FASTAGGREGATEVERIFY` hashes the whole message slice. `R` is built the
   same way; the 166-byte `P` spans two builders.
3. **`id`:** `HASHEXT` id 3 (keccak) over the `XHead.bytes` and `XTail.bytes`
   slices (`2 PUSHINT 3 HASHEXT`).
4. **Keys:** `loadBits(384)` slices of exactly 384 bits from the `KeyChunk`s,
   selected by ascending set bits. The signature slice is exactly 768 bits.
   384-bit keys MUST NOT be loaded as integers.
5. **Call:** build the tuple `t = [k_1 … k_q, q, m, σ]` (length `q + 3 ≤ 24`),
   then `asm "DUP" "TLEN" "UNTUPLEVAR" "BLS_FASTAGGREGATEVERIFY"` (`TLEN`
   `0x6F88`, `UNTUPLEVAR` `0x6F82`, `BLS_FASTAGGREGATEVERIFY` `0xF93002`).
   `UNTUPLEVAR` consumes `t n`, and `TLEN` supplies `n = q + 3`; an
   implementation MAY push `q + 3` explicitly instead. The resulting stack `k_1
   … k_q q m σ` (σ on top) is exactly the opcode's pop order. Gas is 58 000 + 3
   000·q. The opcode applies `DST_SIG` and checks the aggregate; individual-key
   validity rests on Taira's admission (§3.8). `false` throws `BadSignature`.
   The Acton harness pins this stack shape at n = 4, 7 and 31.
6. **Latch:** commit state, emit `sccp_latched`, and return the excess value to
   `response` with no throw. A mint in flight whose bucket `sccp_consumed`
   reply arrives after the latch is not minted: the minter sends
   `sccp_unconsume`, releases `pending_supply`, and the nonce stays voidable
   through `voidFrozen`. Expiry alone does not cancel an in-flight mint.
7. **Sends:** event sends use `SEND_MODE_REGULAR |
   SEND_MODE_BOUNCE_ON_ACTION_FAIL`; burns never pay toward the floor (§5.3.5).
   Failing messages throw and bounce their value.

**Finalize (Taira→TON).**

1. **Minter checks.** `initialized`; `GLOBALID = −239`; the payload (§5.1.5,
   `amount < 2^96`) and, from its nonce, the deploy count of step 2; `msg_value
   ≥` the step value plus the floor deficit (§5.3.5), checked **before** any
   signature; then `X` (inline `VerifyCertificate` as CUR with keys from
   storage, or the checkpoint use check), `Live`, no effective pause, the
   Merkle paths and the deadline. It then checks `total_supply + pending_supply +
   amount ≤ max_supply` and sets `pending_supply += amount`.
2. **Bucket dispatch.** Let `idx = nonce >> 9`.
   - If `idx < deployed_buckets`, send `sccp_consume` (bounceable) to
     `bucket(idx)`.
   - If `deployed_buckets ≤ idx < deployed_buckets + 4`, send
     `sccp_activate_bucket` (bounceable, canonical `StateInit` with `activated
     = false`, `bits = 0`, value = bucket gas + `BUCKET_FLOOR`) to buckets
     `deployed_buckets..=idx` in order, then `sccp_consume` to `bucket(idx)`,
     and set `deployed_buckets = idx + 1`. Messages from the minter to one
     bucket arrive in order, so the bucket is active when the consume arrives.
   - Otherwise throw: the caller first calls `sccp_deploy_buckets`.

   `sccp_consume` never carries a `StateInit`. The minter activates each index
   exactly once, when `deployed_buckets` passes it, or again only through a
   recorded retry of an activation that bounced (and so never took effect).
   Anyone can deploy a bucket's canonical `StateInit`, before the minter does
   or again after a deletion for unpaid rent, but such a bucket stays inactive
   and rejects every consume, range and unconsume. A bucket's flags are
   therefore never reset: a deleted bucket's nonces stay unfinalizable and
   unvoidable rather than becoming voidable again.
3. **Bucket.** Require sender = minter and `activated`, and top the balance up
   to `BUCKET_FLOOR` (§5.3.5). If bit `nonce & 511` is unset, set it and reply
   `sccp_consumed` with the remaining value. Otherwise reply
   `sccp_already_consumed`. Both replies are bounceable.
4. **Minter on `sccp_consumed`.** Require sender = `bucket(nonce >> 9)`,
   recomputed from `bucket_code`.
   - Kind **mint**: if `equivocated`, send `sccp_unconsume` and release
     `pending_supply` (step 6 of the binding). Otherwise `pending_supply −=
     amount`; `total_supply += amount`; `op_count += 1`; send the standard
     `internal_transfer#178d4519` (bounceable, `query_id = nonce`) to the
     recipient's wallet with StateInit and `response_destination = response`;
     emit `sccp_finalized`.
   - Kind **void**: `op_count += 1`; emit `sccp_voided` (count 1); return the
     excess to `response`.

   Every value this handler spends was checked at entry. If it fails anyway
   (for example after a forwarding-price rise between the steps), its
   transaction aborts and `sccp_consumed` bounces: the bucket clears the bit
   and sends `sccp_consume_reverted{nonce, amount}`, paid from its own balance,
   and the minter releases `pending_supply −= amount` (kind void carries
   `amount = 0`). The message becomes finalizable or voidable again.
5. **Minter on `sccp_already_consumed`.** For kind mint, `pending_supply −=
   amount`. Return the value to `response`. If this handler fails, the bounce
   makes the bucket send `sccp_consume_reverted` with the bit unchanged, which
   releases the pending amount.
6. **Minter on a bounced `sccp_consume`** (bucket failed, does not exist or is
   not active): `pending_supply −= amount`. The value stays in the minter,
   because the 256-bit bounce body does not carry `response`.
7. **Minter on a bounced `internal_transfer`**, whose first 256 bits carry
   `query_id = nonce` and `amount`: `total_supply −= amount`, and send a
   bounceable `sccp_unconsume{nonce}` to the bucket, or record the nonce in
   `retries` if the balance cannot pay it. The bucket clears the bit only for
   the minter and only when active, and the message becomes finalizable again.
   A bounced `sccp_unconsume` records the nonce in `retries`. No nonce is ever
   consumed without a mint, a void or a recorded unconsume.

**Retry.** A bounced `sccp_unconsume` or `sccp_activate_bucket` changed nothing
at the bucket, so the minter records it in `retries` instead of losing it.
`sccp_retry{nonce}` requires a record, deletes it and sends the recorded
message again (bounceable); if that bounces too, the record returns. Each
record therefore runs at most once at a time, and an activation is never sent
for a bucket that was ever active. An activation of bucket `i` uses the key `i
· 512`, which cannot collide with an unconsume because no nonce of a
never-activated bucket is ever consumed. A record exists only after a bounce of
a message the minter sent, so `retries` stays empty in practice.

**Void (TON).** `sccp_void_expired*` runs finalize steps 1–4 with kind void: no
pause check, no cap or pending supply, and `now_ms > deadline_ms`, where the
`nonce` field MUST equal the payload nonce. `sccp_void_frozen` requires
`Frozen` and a range inside one bucket (`count ≤ 512`). It applies the same
activation rule and sends `sccp_consume_range`. An active bucket sets all bits
in the range iff all are unset and replies `sccp_range_consumed` (bounceable),
or `sccp_range_rejected` otherwise. The minter then emits `sccp_voided(0,
first, count)`, and a bounced `sccp_range_consumed` makes the bucket clear the
range. A bounced `sccp_consume_range` changes nothing and may be sent again.

**Burn (TON→Taira).**

1. The owner sends TEP-74 `burn#595f07bc query_id amount response_destination
   custom_payload` to its wallet with `custom_payload = sccp_burn_to_taira`.
2. The wallet requires the custom payload, so a plain burn is rejected and no
   value can be burned without a Taira record. It debits the balance and sends
   the extended `burn_notification`.
3. The minter verifies the wallet address; requires the owner to be `addr_std`
   in workchain 0 without anycast; validates the recipient bytes (1..=1024);
   applies `total_supply −= amount` and `nonce = outbound_nonce++`; builds the
   payload (`sender_codec 7` = owner) and computes `message_id`; sets `op_count
   += 1`; reserves only its prior balance (a burn never pays toward
   `MINTER_FLOOR`, §5.3.5); emits `sccp_transfer_to_taira`; and returns the
   excess to `response_destination`.

Any failure, including an event that cannot be sent, aborts the minter's
transaction, and the standard bounce of `burn_notification` restores the wallet
balance.

**Checkpoint and apply control.** These follow §5.1.2–§5.1.3 and §5.1.6 with
keys read from storage, after the entry value check of §5.3.5. A key-changing
rotation hashes `next_keys` against `X.next_committee_root` and replaces the
`KeyChunk` chain; a heartbeat keeps it. The control leaf uses
`lane_bytes(sora-taira, ton-mainnet)` with the stored `taira_network_id`
(target tag `0x44`, identity word `int256(−239)`), `destination_word` = the
minter account id, and the own `route_revision`, hashed in the two builders of
§3.4. An applied control sets `parliament_paused`, `fast_pause_until_ms` and
`control_nonce`, increments `op_count` and emits `sccp_control_applied`. Excess
value returns to `response`.

#### 5.3.5 Value, fees and storage rent

- **Step values.** The required value of each minter entry (checkpoint,
  finalize, void, `void_frozen`, `deploy_buckets`, `apply_control`, `retry`) is
  computed at entry with `GETGASFEE` (per-step gas limits pinned from measured
  maxima), `GETFORWARDFEE` (per-message sizes, including the bucket and wallet
  StateInit and the `sccp_certificate` message) and `GETSTORAGEFEE` (the bucket
  floor and wallet storage). There is no fixed TON constant, so price-config
  changes cannot break flows.
- **Minter floor.** `MINTER_FLOOR` = `GETSTORAGEFEE` for the minter's maximal
  cells and bits over 100 years. Every entry requires `msg_value ≥ step +
  max(0, MINTER_FLOOR − stored)`, where `stored` is the balance before the
  transaction's storage phase (`BALANCE − msg_value + STORAGEFEES`), checked
  before any signature. It then reserves (`raw_reserve`, mode 2)
  `min(max(MINTER_FLOOR, before), before + msg_value − step)`, where `before`
  is the balance after the storage phase: the floor is topped up from the
  caller's value, but never from the part the step needs. Storage the caller
  did not pay for stays a deficit for the next caller. Anyone may add to the
  floor with `top_up`.
- **Burns and replies.** Burns and the bucket replies (`sccp_consumed`,
  `sccp_already_consumed`) reserve only the prior balance: they never pay
  toward the floor, so a minter below its floor cannot make them fail. The
  range reply, `sccp_consume_reverted`, the bounce handlers and TEP-89 answers
  send nothing that carries the balance; bounce handlers run on the minter's
  balance, since a bounce may carry little value.
- **Quotes.** The `*_required_value` get methods return `step + max(0,
  MINTER_FLOOR − balance) + grace`, where a get method's balance is exactly
  `stored`, so a quote does not go stale as time passes. `grace` is
  `GETSTORAGEFEE` of the maximal minter for 7 days. It covers storage that
  other minter transactions collect between the quote and the send; beyond it,
  the call fails `NotEnoughValue` before any signature and bounces. Every
  unused nanoton returns to `response`. Clients add a margin on top.
- **Bucket floor.** Each bucket keeps `BUCKET_FLOOR` = 100 years of its storage
  fee at current prices: its activation carries it, and each consume message
  tops it up again. Anyone may top up a bucket.
- **Buckets are never reset.** A bucket deleted for unpaid rent (practically
  excluded by the floor) makes its nonces unfinalizable and unvoidable until
  someone unfreezes it with its exact public state. Anyone can redeploy its
  canonical `StateInit`, but that bucket is not activated and accepts nothing
  (§5.3.4 step 2), so already-minted nonces never become voidable.
- **Duplicate finalizes.** Parallel duplicate finalizes of one message each
  reserve `pending_supply` until the bucket rejects them. Near the cap this can
  delay honest mints by one round trip; this is accepted.

#### 5.3.6 Get methods

- `get_jetton_data` and `get_wallet_address(owner)` (TEP-74).
- `get_sccp_state()` returns `(initialized, equivocated, taira_network_id,
  consensus_instance, route_revision, initial pin…, root, until_ms, start,
  high, generation, outbound_nonce, op_count, parliament_paused,
  fast_pause_until_ms, effective_paused, control_nonce, total_supply,
  pending_supply, max_supply, deployed_buckets)`.
- `get_sccp_committee()`, `get_sccp_checkpoints()` and
  `get_bucket_address(index)`.
- Quotes (§5.3.5): `checkpoint_required_value()`,
  `finalize_required_value(nonce)`, `void_required_value(nonce)`,
  `void_frozen_required_value(first_nonce)` (the nonce selects how many buckets
  the call activates), `deploy_buckets_required_value(count)`,
  `apply_control_required_value()` and `retry_required_value()`;
  `minter_floor()` returns `MINTER_FLOOR` at current prices;
  `get_sccp_retry(nonce)` returns the recorded retry kind (0 when none).
- Buckets: `get_bucket_data() → (minter, index, activated, bits_hi, bits_lo)`,
  `get_bits()`, `is_consumed(nonce)` and `is_activated()`.

Consumption of a nonce is read from the bucket's account state (`bits`) or its
`get_bits` method. A bucket index ≥ `deployed_buckets` means nothing in it is
consumed. `get_sccp_members`, `get_sccp_tenure` and `rotate_required_value` are
deleted.

#### 5.3.7 Tolk notes

Tolk 1.4.2 has no BLS or keccak builtins, so the contracts declare asm wrappers
for `BLS_FASTAGGREGATEVERIFY` (with the `DUP TLEN UNTUPLEVAR` prefix of
§5.3.4), `HASHEXT` id 0 (SHA-256) and id 3 (keccak256) over builders and
slices, and `GETGASFEE`, `GETFORWARDFEE` and `GETSTORAGEFEE`. TON's BLS opcodes
have been live on mainnet since 2023. The `ECRECOVER` helpers
(`sccp-crypto.tolk`) and roster verification (`sccp-verify.tolk`) are deleted.

### 5.4 Cost estimates

These are estimates, not measurements, at current pricing. `n = 4` is Taira
today and `n = 31` is the protocol maximum. Tests MUST record measured values
(§11); the first measured run records the baseline here, and CI then fails
above 1.1 × that baseline.

**EVM (Prague pricing; BSC prices the precompiles identically).** The
certificate core is hash-to-G2 (≈ 53k) plus the pairing (102.9k) plus `G1ADD`
(≈ 475·(q − 1)) plus checks (≈ 300·q) plus parsing, hashing and memory (≈ 10k):
≈ 167k at `n = 4` and ≈ 183k at `n = 31`. Calldata is ≈ 1.1 KB at `n = 4` (≈
15k gas) and ≈ 3.25 KB at `n = 31` (≈ 48k gas); the EIP-7623 floor does not
bind.

| Operation | n = 4 | n = 31 |
|---|---|---|
| `submitCheckpoints`, 1 certificate (checkpoint SSTORE, `high`) | ≈ 230k | ≈ 280k |
| … with rotation (root and slot B) | +≈ 3k | +≈ 3k |
| … each extra certificate | ≈ 205k | ≈ 255k (16 ≈ 4.1M, below the EIP-7825 cap of 2^24) |
| `finalizeFromCheckpoint` / `voidExpiredFromCheckpoint` / `applyControlFromCheckpoint` | 60–105k / 50–80k / 45–60k | same |
| `finalizeFromTaira` inline | ≈ 275–305k | ≈ 325–355k |
| `applyControl` inline | ≈ 255k | ≈ 305k |
| `voidFrozen`, 256 nonces | ≈ 55k + 1.2k per nonce | same |
| `transferToTaira` | 55k–75k | same |

- One checkpoint serves every proof at or below its height while the
  destination is `Live`.
- Upkeep is one rotation per heartbeat (default once a day, ≈ 233k gas at `n =
  4`) plus one per key-set change (at most 24 a day with the defaults; at most
  48 rotations a day at the 1 h minima, §4.2.2).
- `SccpCertificate` costs ≈ 8k gas on every full-path verification (LOG3 with ≈
  736 bytes of ABI data); the cheap path emits nothing.
- Under the scheduled Glamsterdam repricing (EIP-7976: a 64 gas per calldata
  byte floor; EIP-8037: ≈ 98k per new slot), calldata-heavy inline calls become
  floor-bound; the checkpoint path and the bitmap consumed set keep
  finalization robust to it.

**TON (400 nanoTON per gas).**

| Operation | n = 4 | n = 31 |
|---|---|---|
| Certificate check | ≈ 80k gas (≈ 0.032 TON) | ≈ 140k gas (≈ 0.056 TON) |
| Rotation extra (keccak, ≤ 16 `KeyChunk`s) | +≈ 15k; heartbeat +≈ 2k | +≈ 30k; heartbeat +≈ 2k |
| Inline finalize | check + ≈ 15–20k, plus the unchanged bucket and wallet round trips (≈ 0.02–0.05 TON consumed in total) | same |
| `voidFrozen` | ≈ 10k gas + bucket round trip | same |

A certificate is 4 cells; a key-changing rotation adds at most 16. Stack depth
is at most `q + 3`. The `sccp_certificate` external message re-references the
certificate cells and adds one forward fee.

### 5.5 Toolchains and reproducible artifacts

| Target | Compiler | Settings |
|---|---|---|
| ETH, BSC | solc `0.8.31+commit.fd3a2265` (universal macOS arm64/x86-64, linux-amd64, linux-arm64) | `evmVersion: "cancun"`, `optimizer: {enabled: true, runs: 200}`, `viaIR: false`, `metadata.bytecodeHash: "none"`, `metadata.appendCBOR: false` |
| TON | Acton 1.2.0 bundling Tolk 1.4.2 (`acton-aarch64-apple-darwin`, linux builds) | fixed optimization; code cell hashes and depths locked |

- `scripts/contract_tooling/compiler-lock.json` pins the URLs and sha256 of
  these binaries. `contract_artifact_corridor.py` builds, locks and verifies
  artifacts, including each contract's creation code
  (`SCCP_EVM_CREATION_CODE`), runtime template and `immutableReferences`. No
  Rosetta or Docker is needed on macOS arm64.
- `evmVersion: cancun` must be explicit because the compiler defaults to
  `osaka`. The legacy pipeline avoids the via-IR-only 0.8.31 bugs. The source
  MUST NOT `delete` memory `bytes` elements or use custom storage layouts
  (0.8.31 legacy-pipeline bug patterns).
- `Acton.toml` pins `acton = "1.2.0"` (PascalCase wrapper names), and `acton
  simulator` provides local end-to-end emulation.

## 6. Torii read API (served by every Taira peer from state)

All routes are public GETs (`public_sccp_get` descriptors), JSON or Norito by
`Accept`, and derived only from committed state and the node's own Kura. Every
honest peer therefore returns identical bytes for state-derived content, and
wallets may cross-check peers. Wallets never trust these bytes: certificates,
proofs and digests are verified locally (§7).

Errors are `{code, message}` JSON: `400 sccp_invalid_query`, `404
sccp_not_found`, `410 sccp_pruned` (the data existed but retention removed it,
§4.11, §4.13.1) and `410 sccp_rotation_pruned` (below). A message or control
proof is available as soon as its record height commits; there is no
attestation wait. Immutable responses (proof bundles of an explicit height,
history paths of an explicit `size`, certificates of an explicit height, and
final message states: refunded, stranded, released, bounced) carry a strong
`ETag` over the negotiated representation with `Cache-Control: public,
no-cache`, and a matching `If-None-Match` answers `304`. Paged routes return
the cursor of the next page (`next_from_nonce`, `next_after_nonce`,
`next_before`). The wire types are `iroha_sccp::api` and
`iroha_data_model::sccp::finality` (§8).

**Types** (Taira-internal Norito types; their contract-visible parts are the
fixed byte layouts of §3):

```
SccpCertificateV1 { height: u64, qc: [u8; 117], aggregate_signature: [u8; 96], header: [u8; 221], committee: Vec<[u8; 48]> }

```

The inbound listing scans every inbound record until state indexes them by height |
| `sccp.message.status` | `GET /v1/sccp/messages/{message_id}` | `SccpMessageStatusV1`: `outbound{record, state}` with state `recorded{deadline_ms, provable}\|voided\|refunded\|stranded` (`provable` once the record height is committed), `inbound{record}` whose status is `pending{reason}\|released\|bounced{bounce_message_id}`, or `unknown` (no record: a burn not proven yet) |
| `sccp.message.proof` | `GET /v1/sccp/messages/{message_id}/proof?at=record\|latest\|<H>` | `SccpMessageProofBundleV1`: payload, `deadline_ms`, leaf index, path, the block reference (with a history path when `H` is above the record height) and the certificate of `H`. `at=record` uses the record height; `latest` the durable tip.

Target: claim windows (§4.13.5) |
| `sccp.governance` | `GET /v1/sccp/governance`, `/proposals?status&after`, `/proposals/{proposal_id}` | the revisions per subject; `/proposals` listing every open proposal oldest first with its full `SccpGovernanceProposalV1` body, subjects and `base_revisions`, whether a new attempt would pass the preflight, and its newest attempt; `/proposals/{proposal_id}` showing one proposal in any phase (`proposed\|rejected\|enacted\|superseded\|execution_failed`) with its proposer, body, preflight result and newest attempt. Target: the expected head frozen into each attempt, a diff against current state for `SetParameters` and activation changes, Parliament attempt id, stage and status, and enactment outcome; `readiness`: eligible citizens against the `[gov]` body sizes, the beacon session active and matching the current roster, both launch-gate legs (§10.2), and every active SCCP attempt with its next due item |

Removed with the attestation transport: `/v1/sccp/rosters/*`,
`/v1/sccp/attestations/*` and `/v1/sccp/bridge-keys`. `/v1/bridge/finality/*`
(`specs/bridge_finality.md`) is unchanged, and its proofs carry `X ‖ body` as
the result preimage.

**Building bundles.**

1. Read the certified `SignedBlockWire` of height `H`. Its `CommitCertificate`
   gives the core header, the `CommitQC` and `X ‖ body`; anyone gets the same
   bytes from `GET /v1/bridge/finality/{H}`.
2. Build `qc` per §3.7, and take `header = result_preimage[0..221]`.
   `committee` is the keys of `sccp_committee_generations[X.generation]`, which
   equal the keys of the committee that the certified schedule assigns to `H`.
3. Leaf paths come from the `SccpMessageRecorded` and `SccpControlRecorded`
   events, in `commitment_index` order. History leaves come from
   `SccpBlockCommitted`.
4. A checkpoint reference is the 221-byte `X` alone.
5. Torii MUST verify every bundle it serves with
   `iroha_sccp::v1::finality::verify_certificate` and the §5.1.5 checks.
   Wallets MUST re-verify locally against the target's live `committeeState()`
   before submitting.
6. The wallet or CLI builds EVM calldata locally, decompressing `σ` and the
   signer `y`s with `blst`. Torii serves no calldata and no BoCs.

**Retention.**

- **Rotation archive.** Every node MUST retain an `SccpRotationV1` for every
  generation end whose ending generation `g` has `deadline_ms(g) ≥ t_tip`,
  because a destination still at `g` can use it. The entry is written to a
  node-local archive (`<kura.store_dir>/sccp/rotations/`) when the end block
  commits. Snapshot-bootstrapped nodes backfill missing entries from peers'
  `/v1/sccp/committees/rotations` and verify each against their own state's
  generation record (keys, root, deadline) before storing it. Beyond the
  window, Torii returns `410 sccp_rotation_pruned`; destinations still at such
  a generation are frozen.
- **Anchor witnesses.** The anchor `(core_hash, R)` of height `a` is the
  `(parent_hash, parent_result)` of block `a + 1`'s core header, which every
  certified block carries. A node that holds the Kura blocks of a completed
  chunk can build the 12-hash path for any height in it, and MAY cache chunk
  leaves locally. Validators keep those blocks by default;
  snapshot-bootstrapped nodes MAY answer `404`. Liveness of evidence needs one
  honest archival node.

Writes use the generic `POST /v1/pipeline/transactions`, `GET
/v1/pipeline/transactions/{hash}/status` and `POST /v1/fees/quote`. There are
no SCCP-specific submit endpoints. The Parliament draft route `POST
/v1/gov/proposals/sccp-route-governance`
(`handle_gov_propose_sccp_route_governance`) takes the
`SccpGovernanceProposalV1` payload; Parliament participation uses the generic
Parliament routes, and anonymous ballots use the Parliament's account-free
submission path (ballot spec §6).

## 7. Wallet flows (no hosted services)

Wallets run the native Rust library (§8) against any Taira peer's Torii and the
public RPC endpoints in the user's `[sccp]` client config. These are
third-party endpoints; nothing is operated by the project. Every flow verifies
before paying: certificates against the destination's on-chain committee root,
Merkle paths, and inbound and void proofs through the same `iroha_sccp`
verifier Taira runs. Every flow journals its raw evidence and state transitions
through `iroha_operation_journal`, keyed by `NetworkId`, before submitting
anything, so it resumes after a crash. Deadlines anchored at certified Taira
time can fire up to `2·max_clock_drift_ms` early relative to an individual
clock (§4.3), so wallets submit at least that plus inclusion latency before a
deadline.

### 7.1 Taira → external

1. `GET /v1/sccp/capabilities` and check `network_id` and `consensus_instance`
   against the pinned deployment set. `GET /v1/sccp/registry` returns the
   `Bidirectional` revision `r`; refuse if it is held (forgery hold,
   quarantine, Parliament pause or fast pause).
2. Read the destination: EVM `eth_call` of `committeeState()`, `pauseState()`,
   `equivocated()`, `tairaNetworkId()` and `consensusInstance()`, and the
   `eth_getCode` hash; TON `liteServer.runSmcMethod get_sccp_state`. Refuse on
   any mismatch. Also refuse if:
   - the newest control for `r` leaves the destination paused. The newest
     control is the one with the higher nonce among the destination's
     `pauseState()` and Taira's newest control for `r` (`GET
     /v1/sccp/controls/{network}/{r}`). A pause that Taira recorded but nobody
     has applied yet therefore refuses, and a resume that Taira recorded but
     nobody has applied yet does not: step 5 applies it before finalizing;
   - the destination is not `Live`, or its `committeeState()` root is not
     Taira's record of that generation;
   - no rotation chain from the destination's generation to Taira's current
     generation is available (`/v1/sccp/committees/rotations`), or a generation
     on that chain, or the destination's own `untilMs`, ends before the message
     could be finalized (`outbound_ttl_ms` plus the margin above).
3. `POST /v1/fees/quote`, then sign and `POST /v1/pipeline/transactions` with
   `RecordSccpMessage{network, expected_revision: r, amount, recipient}`. Poll
   the status. Read `message_id` and `deadline_ms` from the
   `SccpMessageRecorded` event, or find the record (sender, amount, recipient)
   in `GET /v1/sccp/outbound/{network}/{r}?from_nonce=<next_outbound_nonce read
   before submitting>` as `iroha sccp send` does, and show the deadline.
4. The message is provable as soon as its block commits (`GET
   /v1/sccp/messages/{id}` reports `provable`).
5. If the destination's generation is behind Taira's current one, `GET
   /v1/sccp/committees/rotations?after_generation=<dest>` and submit one
   `submitCheckpoints([rotations…, latest])` (EVM) or `sccp_checkpoint`
   messages batched in one wallet-v5 external message (TON). If Taira's newest
   control for `r` has a nonce above the destination's `controlNonce`, apply it
   first with `applyControl*` (§5.1.6). A pending resume is thereby applied
   before the finalization; a pending pause stops the finalization, which is
   the intended effect, and the message is refunded through a void after its
   deadline (§7.3).
6. `GET /v1/sccp/messages/{id}/proof?at=record` (or `latest`, or a height whose
   checkpoint the destination stores). Verify locally against the destination's
   live `committeeState()`.
7. Submit before `deadline_ms`: EVM `eth_sendRawTransaction` (EIP-1559 type 2)
   of `finalizeFromCheckpoint` when a covering checkpoint is stored, else
   `finalizeFromTaira`; TON `liteServer.sendMessage` of a wallet-v5 external
   message carrying `sccp_finalize_checkpoint` or `sccp_finalize`. With
   `--emit`, the wallet instead exports the unsigned transaction as raw bytes
   or a QR payload for an external signer. WalletConnect and TON Connect are
   optional adapters.
8. Confirm with `isConsumed(nonce)` or the bucket bits, and the `SccpFinalized`
   log.

Anyone may perform steps 5–7 for the recipient. Wallet software MUST NOT skip
the control step of step 5.

### 7.2 External → Taira

1. **Pre-burn guard.** The revision is `Bidirectional` or `InboundOnly` and
   neither forgery-held nor quarantined (claims on a held revision wait, and a
   quarantined revision's claims settle pro rata once reconciled, with later
   claims bearing any unpriced forgery, §4.10 R4). The lane's light
   client is not frozen, has at least 25 % of its weak-subjectivity bound left,
   and is not within 7 days of `supported_until` (`GET
   /v1/sccp/light-clients/{network}`). The recipient literal decodes (checksum
   verified) to `AccountAddress` bytes of at most 1024 bytes whose controller
   account admission allows. The account need not exist. Refuse otherwise.
2. **Burn.** EVM: read `transferNonces(sender)`, then call
   `transferToTaira(recipient, amount, expectedNonce)` with canonical ABI
   encoding. TON: jetton `burn` with `sccp_burn_to_taira`.
3. **Collect and journal evidence** from public RPC as soon as the source block
   is final:
   - **ETH:** `eth_getTransactionReceipt`, `eth_getBlockReceipts(B)` (rebuild
     the receipt trie), `eth_getBlockByNumber(B)` (re-encode the header and
     check the hash), beacon `/eth/v1/beacon/light_client/finality_update`. For
     ancestry, either `eth_getBlockByNumber(B+1..E)` for `HeaderChain`, or
     `eth_getProof(0x0000F90827F1C53a10cb7A02335B175320002935, [B mod 8191],
     E)` for `HistoryContract` (state at `E` must still be available).
   - **BSC:** the same receipt and header calls, and `eth_getBlockByNumber` of
     descendants for the vote attestation in `extraData`.
   - **Older ETH and BSC burns:** `GET
     /v1/sccp/light-clients/{network}/checkpoints?covering=B` and the headers
     from `B` to that checkpoint (§4.13.5).
   - **TON:** liteserver ADNL (`ton.org/global-config.json` peers):
     `getMasterchainInfo`, `lookupBlock`, `getBlockHeader`, `getBlockProof`
     (forward from the epoch's key block for the signatures of the burn's own
     masterchain block, or backward to it from the first block after the newest
     stored key block), `getShardBlockProof`, `getTransactions`,
     `getOneTransaction`.
4. `GET /v1/sccp/light-clients/{network}` and `/sets`. If the light client does
   not cover the evidence, build `AdvanceSccpLightClientV1` updates with
   `expected_state_hash`: ETH `/eth/v1/beacon/light_client/updates`; BSC set
   transitions; TON key-block `getBlockProof` links. Each advance is stepped to
   the light client's bounds; repeat until it covers the evidence. The builders
   pick the proof's anchor as §4.13.5 states. When the anchor is a checkpoint
   beyond one proof's ancestry bound, the evidence also carries `Backfill`
   advances (`expected_state_hash: None`).
5. Run the verifier locally against the light client, sets and checkpoints read
   in step 4, with the backfills applied in order, then submit **promptly**
   (§4.13.5). The backfills go first, each in its own transaction (`iroha sccp
   claim` does all of this). Then:
   - A user without XOR submits a self-claim `[Register<Account>(self)?,
     AdvanceSccpLightClientV1…, SubmitSccpInboundMessageV1]` signed by the
     recipient key (§4.12.4). Until bundled advances are verified at admission
     (`TODO(ws41)`), only the form without advances is fee-exempt, so the
     advances go first in a separate transaction (a keeper's, or a funded
     account's).
   - Otherwise the user submits the same instructions from any funded account.
6. If the record is `Pending` (revision paused or held, SCCP disabled), retry
   later with `SettleSccpV1::Inbound(message_id)`.

### 7.3 Refunds (outbound that did not mint)

1. After `deadline_ms`, check `isConsumed(nonce)` or the bucket bits. If the
   nonce is unconsumed:
   - if the destination is `Live`, submit `voidExpired*` with the same kind of
     proof as finalization;
   - if the destination is frozen (expired or latched), submit
     `voidFrozen(first, count)` over the unconsumed range (`GET
     /v1/sccp/outbound/{network}/{revision}`).
2. Collect the void evidence exactly as in §7.2 steps 3–5 (the `SccpVoided` log
   or the TON `sccp_voided` external-out), and submit
   `SubmitSccpOutboundVoidV1`. The same builders and anchors apply, so void
   evidence ages like a burn: the §4.13.5 windows hold, and an older void is
   proven from a checkpoint with backfills. If the refund is left `Pending`
   (the revision is held), retry with `SettleSccpV1::Refund`.

### 7.4 Destination upkeep, deployment and registration

- **Committee sync.** Anyone runs `iroha sccp committee sync --target
  <profile>`, which reads `committeeState()`, walks
  `/v1/sccp/committees/rotations`, submits one `submitCheckpoints` and applies
  the newest pending control. It must run at least once per
  `committee_validity_ms − committee_heartbeat_ms` (13 d with the defaults,
  §4.2.3) per destination; every finalizing wallet also does it as a side
  effect. Route operators run it as a funded relayer duty, and the deployment
  runbook names the owner. Validator nodes do not rotate destinations, because
  they hold no external-chain funds.
- **Control relay.** After the Parliament enacts `SetDestinationPaused`, or the
  fast pause track enacts a pause, anyone (normally the proposer or a panel
  member) runs `iroha sccp control apply --target <profile>`, which fetches
  `/v1/sccp/controls/{network}/{revision}/{nonce}/proof` for the newest control
  and submits `applyControl*` (`sccp_apply_control*` on TON). `iroha sccp
  control status` compares Taira's newest control with the destination's
  `pauseState()`. A confirming Parliament pause MUST be delivered before the
  fast pause it confirms lapses (§4.14.7).
- **Watch and evidence.** `iroha sccp monitor` compares each destination's
  `committeeState()`, `checkpointHeader` and `pauseState()` against Taira,
  alerts at `untilMs − 3 d`, and builds forgery evidence on divergence (`iroha
  sccp evidence build|submit`, with `evidence anchor` for the witness). For
  every held revision it prints the `AttestSccpDeploymentProgress` or
  `QuarantineSccpRevision` proposal it needs (§4.10). Validator nodes do the
  same through the keeper watch (§4.13.4).
- **Light-client keeper.** This runs in validator nodes by default (§4.13.4).
  Anyone may also run `iroha sccp light-client advance --network <p>`.
- **Fast pause.** Panel members run `iroha sccp fast-pause
  panel|accept|endorse|status` (§4.14.7).
- **Deployment.** `iroha sccp deployment deploy <evm|ton>` deploys from locked
  artifacts with the deployer's key: EVM only through `SCCP_EVM_DEPLOYER`
  (§5.2.1), TON with its canonical initial data followed by `sccp_init`. It
  pins a retained generation that satisfies P2 at the expected enactment time,
  read from the operator's own node or cross-checked across the configured
  peers, and prints the `RegisterRoute` action. Ethereum and BSC deployments of
  one revision get different addresses because their constructor arguments
  differ, so destination words stay unique (§4.14.3).
- **Registration and every other decision.** Once the launch gate is open
  (§10.2), a bonded citizen (or a holder of `CanProposeSccpRouteGovernance`)
  runs `iroha sccp governance propose --actions <file>`, which builds and
  checks an `SccpGovernanceProposalV1` (for a new route: `RegisterRoute`,
  `InitializeLightClient` with a bootstrap from `iroha sccp light-client
  bootstrap build`, and `ActivateRevision`) and submits
  `ProposeSccpRouteGovernance`. Reviewers run `iroha sccp deployment verify`
  and `iroha sccp light-client bootstrap verify` (§4.14.4) against the body
  shown by `iroha sccp governance show`. Anyone MAY run `iroha sccp governance
  drive` (§4.14.5 item 4). Seated members act with the `iroha gov parliament`
  commands and the Parliament wallet, and enactment is automatic (§4.14.3).

## 8. Off-chain Rust

- **`crates/iroha_sccp`** is network-free and linked into `iroha_core`. It
  holds:
  - the v1 payload codec and amount rules, hashes, transfer and control leaves,
    Merkle and history functions;
  - `v1::finality`: `X`, `QC_FIXED`, `R`, the Commit preimage `P`, `m`,
    `checkpoint_id` and `verify_certificate`;
  - `v1::committee`: the committee root and the §5.1.2 destination state
    machine as the reference for both contracts;
  - `v1::evidence`: the §4.9 E1–E4 reference, anchor leaves, chunk roots and
    paths, used by Torii, the CLI and the keeper for pre-checks;
  - `v1::constants`, including `SCCP_EVM_DEPLOYER` and
    `SCCP_EVM_CREATION_CODE`; `v1::evm_abi` and `v1::ton_cell` encoders for
    every §5 entry point;
  - the `SccpGovernanceProposalV1` static validation and subject mapping;
  - the per-chain inbound and void verifiers and light-client logic (Ethereum,
    BSC, TON);
  - TON cell hashing and StateInit address derivation;
  - Torii DTOs (`api.rs`).
- **`crates/iroha_crypto`** gains the consensus signing API `bls::consensus`
  (`DST_SIG`, `ConsensusDigest::from_preimage` over the allowlist, `sign`,
  `verify`, `verify_fast_aggregate`, `verify_aggregate_multi` and
  `verify_fast_aggregate_committed`; `specs/sumeragi.md` §1 item 6). The w3f
  transcript and proof of possession are unchanged.
- **`crates/iroha_sccp_rpc`** (std; network I/O) is used by the irohad keeper,
  the CLI and the wallet. It holds:
  - endpoint lists with failover, and per-endpoint secret headers read from
    owner-only files;
  - blocking `reqwest` (rustls, no `json` feature) with `norito::json` parsing;
  - RPC hygiene, because every endpoint is untrusted and validators share the
    compiled lists:
    - one wall-clock deadline per attempt for connecting, sending and reading
      the whole answer (a body that trickles in is cut off at the deadline, not
      merely between reads), and an optional per-poll budget (`PollBudget`)
      past which no attempt starts and no backoff sleeps;
    - a byte cap per route sized to its real answers (beacon light-client
      updates scale with the requested count; `eth_getBlockReceipts` uses the
      64 MiB transport ceiling), and per TON query kind, checked against the
      announced size before reading;
    - JSON admitted by an allocation-free lexical preflight (at most one value
      per 8 bytes of the cap, nesting depth 32) and then built under a Norito
      decode budget of 6 × the cap. All limits derive from the cap alone, so
      every node applies the same bounds to the same route. Bodies over a cap
      or a limit fail over; they never panic or allocate without bound;
    - typed decoding inside the attempt. A non-failover answer about the
      request (HTTP 404 or another client status, a JSON-RPC or API error,
      malformed data, a non-failover `liteServer.error`) is returned, and the
      next request starts at the next endpoint. Callers whose build fails on
      served data, or whose verification rejects it, rotate explicitly
      (`rotate_preferred`, or a builder's `rotate_endpoints`, which the keeper
      calls after such a failed build);
    - start indices seeded per caller (`endpoint_seed` derives a seed from
      bytes such as the peer id), so the keepers of different validators start
      at different endpoints. Explicit CLI and wallet lists keep their order;
  - EVM JSON-RPC, the beacon API (JSON light-client and header routes), and a
    TON ADNL-TCP liteclient with its ADNL handshake crypto built from workspace
    crypto crates;
  - destination readers for the keeper watch and `monitor` (`SccpCertificate`
    and committee events, `sccp_certificate` external messages,
    `committeeState()`, `pauseState()`);
  - the compiled default public endpoint lists that `iroha_config` exposes as
    defaults;
  - builders for advances, backfills, inbound proofs, void proofs and
    light-client bootstraps, behind the `builders::SourceChainBuilder` entry
    points that the keeper, the CLI and wallets share. Advances are stepped to
    a byte budget, evidence anchors are chosen as §4.13.5 states, and
    `LightClientReplayV1` verifies evidence against a local replay of Taira's
    light client before anything is submitted.
- **`crates/iroha_sccp_wallet`** (std; never in the `irohad` graph, enforced by
  the `sccp_wallet` layer in `ci/dependency_budget.json`) holds:
  - `pure/`: bundle verification (BLS through `blst`), the §5.1.2 committee
    state machine for planning `submitCheckpoints`, EVM ABI encoding and
    EIP-1559 signing, TON cell/BoC builders and wallet-v5 messages. These are
    FFI-exportable for SDK bridges;
  - `journal.rs`: the resumable journal keyed by `NetworkId`, built on
    `iroha_operation_journal`. The resumable, journaled flows of §7 that write
    through it are still to be built (`TODO(ws51)`);
  - `config.rs`: the client-config `[sccp]` table (file-only): endpoint lists,
    timeouts and pinned deployments per `NetworkId`.
- **`crates/irohad`** has the SCCP keeper `sccp_keeper.rs` (§4.13.4:
  keepalives, light-client advances and the watch), a supervised task with one
  schedule per network and short-lived state views, configured through
  `[sccp.keeper]` and `[sccp.light_client_keeper]` (user → actual → defaults;
  no environment variables), and the start-up refusal of a staking policy that
  fails L1 while SCCP exists (§4.8).
- **CLI** `iroha sccp {info, routes, recent, send, status, proof, finalize,
  committee show|rotations|sync, control status|apply, burn, claim, settle,
  void, refund, light-client status|advance|backfill|bootstrap build|bootstrap
  verify, lc-profile, deployment deploy|verify, governance propose|show|drive,
  evidence build|submit|status|anchor, fast-pause panel|accept|endorse|status,
  monitor, reconcile prove-mint|status}`.
  - `governance propose` builds, statically validates and submits
    `ProposeSccpRouteGovernance`; Parliament participation uses the `iroha gov
    parliament` commands and the Parliament wallet. There is no governance
    signing command, because no key approves anything.
  - `governance drive` is the optional driver of §4.14.5 item 4.
  - Taira keys come from `account.private_key_file`. External keys come only
    from owner-only key files or `iroha_wallet` named wallets. `--emit` exports
    unsigned transactions for external signers. No keys on argv or in
    environment variables.
- **SDKs (phase 2):** read models, `RecordSccpMessage` building, bundle
  verification and destination encoding, via `connect_norito_bridge` (Swift,
  Kotlin, C#) and `iroha_js_host` (JS). Python only verifies. Java has no SCCP
  surface.

## 9. Security analysis

### 9.1 Trust assumptions and operational dependencies

| Direction | Safety holds if | Liveness needs |
|---|---|---|
| Taira → X | (1) **Taira consensus:** at most `f` Byzantine members per committee, for Taira's own safety. (2) **Historical-key accountability:** every generation `g` that a destination may still trust either has at most `f` Byzantine members, or its forging coalition is economically accountable: every member stays bonded while `g` is liable (§4.8), and every destination-valid certificate of `g` whose block or result is not Taira's is slashable on Taira (§4.9). (3) **Destination progress:** a destination chain's finalized time passes each generation's deadline within `grace_ms + progress_cap_ms` of it (37 d by default), the inbound light clients are safe, and relay plus inclusion latency stays below `grace_ms` (§4.8). (4) The deployment was pinned to a genuine generation and registered by the Parliament (§9.7). (5) Correct destination code | `q` running honest members per committee; one keepalive submitter on an idle chain; one honest submitter on X before the deadline; a committee sync within the validity window, done by any finalizer or relayer. Otherwise a void and refund recovers the value |
| X → Taira | the source chain's finality assumption (ETH ≥ 2/3 sync committee; BSC ≥ 2/3 Parlia BLS votes; TON > 2/3 validator weight) within the weak-subjectivity bound, **and** Taira BFT, **and** a genuine Parliament-enacted light-client bootstrap | one submitter within the claim window (§4.13.5); a light client kept within `ws_bound` by wallets or keepers, or re-initialized by the Parliament |
| Governance | the SORA Parliament enacts only what its seated citizens approve: honest sortition (beacon uniqueness), a sound binding ballot (anonymous on-chain ballots, `specs/parliament_private_ballot_design.md`) and a citizen majority in each body; the fast pause panel is trusted for pauses only (§9.13) | a seated Parliament with a qualified ballot; the global beacon; keepalives on an idle chain; for the fast pause, a non-blocked panel (§4.14.7) |

The current committee's BFT assumption alone is not sufficient, because
departed members keep their keys. This design makes no forward-security claim
for departed keys before their deadline: it makes their misuse slashable and
bounds it in time. For liveness, honest clocks are within `max_clock_drift_ms /
2` of real time; certified time is then at most `2·max_clock_drift_ms` ahead of
any individual honest clock (§4.3).

**Removed assumptions:** honest bridge keys, attestor liveness and bridge-key
fault economics. **Consensus keys are now bridge keys.** They are hot,
in-process keys; external custody of vote keys is out of scope (§13). An
operator is liable for every signature of its consensus key while any
generation that contained it is liable, so operators MUST keep a retired key
secret until then and SHOULD destroy it afterwards; by then every destination
network's finalized time has passed the deadline, or the cap has expired, and
no destination accepts it.

Taira today runs 4 validators on one host under one custody owner, and its
genesis citizens are provisioned by the same reset tooling, so the effective
trust in every direction is that operator. The protocol is correct for any `n ≤
31` and any citizen count; decentralization is a deployment property.

**Operational dependencies.** None of these is a hosted service, and none adds
trust, but each needs someone to act:

- after each Taira reset, and once the launch gate is open, someone redeploys
  three mainnet contracts, a citizen makes the bring-up proposals (§4.14.5),
  and the Parliament enacts them;
- the Parliament must stay seated: citizens respond within the windows and cast
  their ballots, and validators run the beacon signers;
- validators need do nothing for SCCP itself: their nodes produce finality
  headers as part of execution, and the keeper submits keepalives, advances
  light clients and watches destinations by default, from a key that needs no
  funds because those transactions are fee-exempt (§4.13.4). Validators must
  accept the SCCP staking floor (§4.8 L1): their stake is released only after
  their generations stop being liable;
- someone keeps each destination's committee current and applies controls (any
  finalizing wallet does both as a side effect, §7.1);
- keeper and wallet traffic uses third-party public RPC endpoints, which may
  rate-limit or require API keys (supported through secret header files);
- WalletConnect needs a project id, which is why raw-transaction and QR export
  are the default hand-off;
- every public Taira Torii hostname currently resolves to one host
  (`configs/soranexus/taira/dns_records.json`), so cross-checking peers gives
  no independence today. Wallets rely on local verification, not on peer
  agreement.

### 9.2 Replay

- **Destination:** each (revision, nonce) is consumed at most once, by either a
  mint or a void (bitmap or bucket). Nonces are dense and unique per revision,
  because Taira assigns them in deterministic serial execution. The leaf binds
  the destination contract, the payload binds the revision and domains, and the
  message id binds both network identities, so a message cannot be minted
  twice, or on another contract, chain, revision or Taira network. A TON bucket
  accepts flags only after the minter's one-time activation, so a bucket
  redeployed by anyone stays inactive and its bits cannot be reset.
- **Taira:** `sccp_inbound_messages[message_id]` is permanent. Message ids are
  unique because source nonces are per-sender (EVM) or serialized (TON), and
  the payload includes the sender, nonce and revision. Void proofs act only on
  records in status `Recorded`.
- **Certificates:** `P` binds `I` (chain, reset, instance), the height and kind
  `0x03`; `X` binds the network. Checkpoints are idempotent per `keccak256(X)`.
  Rotations are generation-locked, and a replayed or stale certificate never
  extends trust (§5.1.2).
- **Controls:** a destination applies a control only with a nonce above the
  last applied one, so a stale control can never be replayed after a newer one,
  and each leaf carries the complete state. The control leaf binds the Taira
  network, the target network, the destination word and the revision, so a
  control cannot be applied to another deployment, chain, revision or Taira
  network.
- **Governance:** each Parliament decision is enacted at most once, and its
  per-subject expected head supersedes it if another decision changed the same
  subject first (§4.14.3). Fast-pause endorsements bind the panel, the network
  and the current `FastHold` head. No signed governance statement exists to
  replay.
- **Evidence:** forgery records are deduplicated per `(generation, validator)`;
  anchors bind their height.

### 9.3 Rogue keys and key admission

Consensus keys enter a committee only with the w3f proof of possession, checked
at genesis, in every epoch context and at admission, together with
`KeyValidate`. That makes `FastAggregateVerify` rogue-key secure for every
admitted key, and the PoP's hash domain differs from `DST_SIG`, so a PoP is
never a consensus signature. Destinations aggregate only keys committed by a
root they accepted (the Parliament-pinned generation, or a successor certified
by the current generation), so they inherit Taira's checks. Taira's strict key
ordering excludes duplicates, and TON re-checks ordering when it installs keys.
There is no peer key-consent signature in this release; `RegisterPeerWithPop`
is unchanged.

### 9.4 Signature counting and malleability

Contracts and Taira enforce: exactly `q = n − f` signers (`popcount(signers) =
q`; signer supersets are rejected), bits `≥ n` zero, LSB-first bitmap order,
canonical compressed keys with the right flags and sign bit, every `y` and `σ`
limb below `p`, `σ ≠ O` and in the subgroup, and `apk ≠ O`. Different
exact-quorum subsets are valid for the same block and result (certificates are
per node), so evidence deduplicates per validator, not per certificate.
Consumption is keyed by nonce, never by signature bytes.

### 9.5 Domain separation

- `DST_SIG` is reserved to the allowlisted consensus API (kinds `0x01`–`0x05`
  and RS16 statements, exact preimage lengths). Every other BLS context keeps
  the w3f transcript, and the PoP binds its own key under the w3f DST (§3.8).
- ASCII role tags separate the payload, message, transfer leaf, control leaf,
  node, history, committee, finality header, result, result body, anchor and
  evidence hashes. Leaf and node preimages differ in prefix and length, and
  verifiers compute leaves themselves, so an internal node cannot pass as a
  leaf and a transfer cannot pass as a control or the reverse.
- Proofs are positional and bind the leaf index and count against an
  authenticated `message_count` or `history_size`.
- The keeper key signs only the node's own Taira transactions (keepalives,
  advances and evidence); no key signs caller-supplied bytes.

### 9.6 Cross-chain and cross-route confusion

The same certificate is valid on every destination by design. Each destination
accepts only leaves with its own destination word, domains, revision and route
id. Control leaves carry the Taira and target network bytes, the destination
word and the revision. Destination words are unique across all registered
routes and revisions. A contract deployed on the wrong chain is rejected by the
`block.chainid` / `GLOBALID` check and could mint only unregistered,
unredeemable tokens; CREATE2 addresses depend on the network tag, so the
Ethereum and BSC deployments of a revision differ.

### 9.7 Deployment integrity

**Threat.** An attacker deploys a contract with a fake initial committee. It
mints to itself, burns back to zero supply, rotates to the real generation and
gets the deployment registered. That would pre-consume honest nonces and leave
provable burns that drain escrow.

**Defense.** The initial pin is part of the deployment's identity: Taira
recomputes the EVM CREATE2 address from the locked creation code and the pin,
and the TON address from canonical initial data built from its own generation
record (§4.14.3 P3, P4), and `RegisterRoute` checks the pin against that record
(P1). Reviewers additionally verify live state (zero op count and supply, a
genuine committee chain, genuine checkpoints) before the decision and before
activation (§4.14.4). With a genuine pin, no mint, void or burn is possible
before registration without a genuine certificate; a forged handoff by the
pinned generation is slashable while it is liable.

### 9.8 Taira reset

A reset gives a new `NetworkId` (enforced by the genesis reset nonce), which
means a new `I`, a new `X.network_id`, new lane bytes and new committee
generations. No old certificate, message or burn is valid across the reset. The
Parliament should pause old deployments before the reset (§4.18); either way
they freeze when their last generation's deadline passes. Their burns are not
accepted by the new Taira. The stranded value is the documented cost (§4.18).

### 9.9 Long-range attacks and weak subjectivity

| Case | Bound |
|---|---|
| Departed key set; destination maintained | Rotated past at the next heartbeat or key change; afterwards its signatures have no effect there (§5.1.2) |
| Destination nobody maintains | Trusted until `deadline_ms(cur)` ≤ certified start + validity (14 d by default, 30 d at most), then frozen and drained through voids |
| Replay of a certified `X`; future-dated `X` | No extension; `t_eff` caps a rotation's start at `now_ms` (§5.1.2) |
| A departed quorum forges within its deadline | Out-of-tenure checkpoints lead to a V3 latch on the genuine handoff; an in-tenure false `X` leads to V1 if the genuine one is stored, else it is bounded by the cap and the deadline; a forged rotation captures the destination. In every case the signers are slashable while `g` is liable, and every revision that can be at `g` is held (§4.9–§4.10) |
| Destination halts, then resumes with backdated blocks | `g` stays liable until the destination's light client finalizes a header past `deadline_ms(g)`, plus `grace_ms`, up to `progress_cap_ms` (§4.8 L5) |
| Taira halts, then resumes with a time jump | The liability clock advances by at most one step across the halt, so no liability window is consumed (§4.8) |
| Keys compromised after `g` stops being liable | Every destination's finalized time is past the deadline, or the cap has expired; no destination accepts them, stake may be released, and nothing needs slashing |
| Idle Taira | Heartbeat keepalive (§4.7) |
| Halted Taira | Destinations freeze at the deadline, then voids |
| Network reset reusing a genesis | Forbidden: resets MUST change the genesis hash, hence `I` and the network id |

Inbound light clients enforce per-chain `ws_bound_ms` against Taira block time
and freeze on proven equivocation. Keeping destinations synced is the operative
defence on the outbound side, and every finalizing wallet syncs as a side
effect.

### 9.10 Liveness, censorship and failure recovery

- **Censorship.** Censoring `RecordSccpMessage`, proofs, voids, keepalives or
  evidence on Taira requires control of proposers across leader rotation.
  Destination-side censorship affects only timing, because every destination
  call is permissionless and idempotent. A quorum of the current generation can
  halt Taira and censor evidence; that is outside the model, like any
  compromise of Taira's consensus (§9.12).
- **Finality liveness.** The proof of every SCCP block exists when the block
  commits, so there is no attestor or handoff to stall. Idle chains produce
  exactly the blocks heartbeats and governance work need (§4.7). A missed key
  change degrades into a resync, and destinations at the old generation freeze
  safely (§4.6).
- **Destination freeze, pause, hold or retirement never strands value.**
  Unminted outbound messages are voided and refunded (§4.16), including on a
  paused destination, where `voidExpired` stays open. Revision states admit
  proofs everywhere except `Staged`. `Retired` requires zero liability. Held
  settlement waits; quarantined settlement is reconciled (§4.10).
- **Pause latency.** A fast pause takes one endorsement window of a standing
  panel plus one block and a control delivery (§4.14.7); a full-track pause
  takes a full Parliament round (§4.14.5). Until a control is applied, the
  destination keeps minting what certificates cover. What bounds the damage
  meanwhile: the immutable destination cap; Taira's liability accounting;
  honest wallets, which apply a recorded control before finalizing (§7.1); and,
  for forgeries, slashing and per-revision holds.
- **Inbound.** A proof, once accepted, never expires (§4.12). Claim windows
  bind only the prove step (§4.13.5), and wallets prove promptly. Light clients
  are kept fresh by claims and by the in-node keeper. A source-chain hard fork
  beyond `supported_until` is recovered by a release that appends an extending
  profile version and its Parliament activation (§4.13.2). A stale or frozen
  light client, or a burn older than its window, is recovered by Parliament
  re-initialization or a trusted checkpoint, with bootstraps built and checked
  from public RPC by reviewers. Wallets refuse to burn when a lane is at risk
  (§7.2).
- **Governance liveness.** Without a seated Parliament with a qualified ballot,
  no route can be registered (§10.2); once routes exist, value keeps flowing
  and voids and refunds stay available even if the Parliament stalls, and the
  fast pause track still works. A binding ballot whose turnout misses quorum
  ends `NoQuorum` (§4.14.5 item 2), and cheap citizenship lets an attacker seat
  silent members, so the Taira bond must be out of faucet reach (§4.14.5 item
  1).
- **`enabled = false`** stops only value movement. Proofs, generations,
  controls, evidence and Parliament enactment keep running (§4.1).

### 9.11 Economic safety

- Destination supply ≤ the immutable cap. Taira never records a message that
  would exceed it (§4.15), so no certified message is unmintable because of the
  cap.
- Taira releases, bounces and refunds only up to the revision's liability. A
  compromised source-chain verification can drain at most the route's escrow,
  and a forged bounce is bounded the same way. A forged Taira certificate can
  mint at most the destination cap minus supply on the destinations still at
  the forged generation.
- **The slashable floor.** Torii publishes `coalition_slashable_floor(g)` for
  the current generation: the sum of the `f + 1` smallest liable exposures of
  `g`'s members, times `max_slash_bps / 10 000`. The cheapest forging coalition
  has `f + 1` members, because up to `f` honest stray Commit votes can complete
  a certificate (§9.12). The floor is **seizable collateral**, not a guaranteed
  attacker loss: exposure includes nominators' delegated stake, so operators
  may lose less and nominators bear part of it. Slashed stake goes to
  `slash_sink_account_id`; it does not compensate holders of a captured
  deployment, whom reconciliation (§4.10) pays from that revision's escrow.
  Each `(g, validator)` is penalized once, and a 100 % slash leaves nothing for
  a later generation that reuses the key. `max_slash_bps ≥ 1` while SCCP exists
  (L1), and the Kagami profiles use 10 000.
- **Damage and race window.** Damage is bounded by the sum of the caps of the
  destinations that can be at the forged generation. Taira-side release of
  every such revision stops when the evidence is recorded. An attacker can
  forge, mint, burn and claim inbound settlement before that, within the time
  from the forged destination transaction to evidence recording, measured
  against the source chain's finality for the burn proof: seconds to minutes on
  TON and BSC, about 13 minutes on Ethereum. The keeper watch and `monitor`
  shrink it, using the published certificates (§5.1.3). An inbound settlement
  delay is open (§13).
- **Coverage is not promised.** The Parliament SHOULD keep the sum of
  `max_wrapped_supply` at or below `coalition_slashable_floor`. This is not
  enforced on chain, because stake moves continuously (§13).
- Recipient problems cannot lose value: an absent account is registered at
  settlement; an undecodable or uncreditable recipient bounces (§4.12.5); a
  voided bounce lands in `stranded`, which only the Parliament can release.
- Dust: `min_outbound_amount` bounds the permanent records a sender can create
  per fee. Self-claims pay `inbound_self_claim_fee` from their proceeds, and
  the per-class quotas and pending limits bound fee-exempt load.

### 9.12 Key compromise

- **At most `f` keys of every generation a destination trusts:** no forgery,
  even with `f` honest stray Commit votes.
- **`f + 1` to `q − 1` keys of a generation `g`:** they can complete the stray
  Commit votes of one block that never committed into a certificate for that
  block. Up to `f` honest members may have Commit-voted a block that never
  committed (a hidden PrepareQC followed by a commit of another block in a
  later view; any timeout certificate intersects at least `f + 1` honest Commit
  voters, which would force the re-proposal, so at most `f` such stray votes
  exist for any block). That certificate is E3 evidence: the forgery is
  slashable and every revision at `g` is held. Strict liability then also
  slashes the honest stray signers; this needs `f + 1` colluding or stolen keys
  of `g`, beyond `g`'s BFT bound, so it is accepted, and finer attribution is
  open (§13). With more than `f` Byzantine members, honest members can also be
  led to sign conflicting Commits across views (`specs/sumeragi.md` §3.6), and
  strict liability may slash them; that happens only after `g`'s BFT assumption
  has failed.
- **`q` keys of a departed generation, within its deadline:** this affects only
  destinations still at that generation (§5.1.2). It is slashable while `g` is
  liable, and those revisions are held.
- **`q` keys of the current generation:** the holders control Taira's
  consensus. They can halt it and censor evidence, so the Taira response does
  not apply. This is outside the model, like any compromise of Taira's
  consensus.
- **After liability ends:** no effect.
- **A keeper key:** it can only submit keepalives, advances and evidence, each
  verified like anyone's. Its holder gains no authority; the operator deletes
  the key and the node generates a new one.

### 9.13 Governance: the Parliament and the fast pause panel

- **Trust.** The Parliament is part of the trusted base for what it enacts. A
  captured Parliament could register a malicious deployment and let users send
  value into it (bounded by that revision's liability), re-initialize a light
  client from a fake bootstrap or install a fake checkpoint and release that
  route's escrow against forged burns (bounded by the route's liabilities),
  release `stranded` value, attest false deployment progress to release a
  forgery hold (bounded by the held revision's liability), pause or resume
  destinations, or change parameters within their rules. It cannot mint on a
  destination, forge a certificate, move escrow of another route, or change a
  deployment's cap, committee or consumed nonces. **Destinations need no
  Parliament key:** a valid control proof shows that `q` members of the
  destination's current generation signed Commit for the enacting block, so
  "the Parliament enacted this at `h`" holds exactly when Taira is safe
  (§10.3).
- **The fast pause panel** is trusted for pauses only. A captured panel can
  delay minting, recording and settlement on one network for
  `fast_pause_hold_ms` per enactment, renewable while seated, and nothing else;
  the Parliament bounds it with suspension and a lift (§4.14.7). Blocking needs
  a blocking minority in both panels.
- **Citizenship cost.** The Parliament and the panels are only as
  Sybil-resistant as the citizen bond. On Taira, XOR comes from a faucet, so
  the bond MUST be far beyond faucet reach and the faucet MUST use adaptive
  difficulty (§4.14.5 item 1). Cheap citizens could otherwise capture bodies or
  panels within the powers above, or stall full-track rounds.
- **What validators contribute.** Validators produce blocks and run the global
  beacon. Under the beacon's uniqueness a threshold of them can withhold or
  delay pulses (liveness; with the parent proposer, a choice among panel
  draws), but cannot choose members, findings, proposals or outcomes. They hold
  no ballot custody and cannot open, read or alter ballots; ordinary block
  execution verifies ballots and derives the counts
  (`specs/parliament_private_ballot_design.md` §1).
- **No clerk.** SCCP attempts and their progress transitions are permissionless
  and core-derived (§4.14.5 item 3), so no account outside the Parliament
  chooses which SCCP proposals reach the bodies or when.
- **Review.** Every enacted body is public before the vote (§6), and reviewers
  can check deployments and bootstraps with local tools against their own
  endpoints (§4.14.4, §4.13.4). Enactment re-checks every on-Taira
  precondition, including the deployment addresses, the pin and the bootstrap's
  freshness.
- **Latency** is a governance property (§4.14.5); the fast pause track covers
  emergencies.

## 10. Parliament dependency and launch gate

### 10.1 What SCCP consumes

The Parliament's ballot and certificates are owned by the Parliament workstream
(`specs/parliament_private_ballot_design.md`). SCCP needs only:

- the 32-byte `GovernanceCertificateId` (`derive_v1`) and the certificate's
  32-byte `effect_preimage_hash`;
- `s0: GovernanceAnchorV1 { height, position, timestamp_ms }`, the casting-open
  anchor of the approving Policy Jury ballot behind the certificate (ballot
  spec §3.4, §11);
- deterministic block-start enactment: one rollback-isolated transaction per
  certificate, calling `sccp::governance::enact(certificate_id, effect_hash,
  s0, proposal)`;
- the block-start position of each processed item (§4.7.2), recorded for ballot
  openings;
- `parliament_sccp_attempt_latency_ms()`, the latency of one full-track SCCP
  attempt including a single sortition-retry generation, for the hold rule
  (§4.1), with the Parliament's parameter path re-checking that rule;
- reuse of the citizen-eligibility predicate and of the governance draw by the
  pause panel;
- a read-only iterator over due G1–G3 items for `governance_due`, whose
  predicate SCCP owns (§4.7.3);
- `parliament_binding_ballot_available() -> bool` (§10.2).

SCCP parses no other certificate internals, so ballot-binding fields can change
without touching SCCP.

**Interface items with the Parliament workstream.** Confirmed on 2026-10-05:
(1) `enact` takes the full `s0` anchor, which the lift rule needs (§4.14.7;
ballot spec §11); (2) the two `governance_due` corrections: pulse requests are
due only at their exact slot, and fast-pause lapses are not due (§4.7.3); (4)
both panels decide, with seat acceptance and a reserve, so a decline, a
blocking minority or a `NoResult` in one panel never blocks the other, and the
capture figures use the union of the two panels (§4.14.7); (5) the clock
residual is `2·max_clock_drift_ms` relative to an individual honest clock
(§4.3; ballot spec §3.4), and because anchors, `s0` included, can be stale by
the prepare-to-commit lag, a ballot's closure is anchored to the block after
its opening (§4.7.2 G2b; ballot spec §3.4). The hold rule uses
`parliament_sccp_attempt_latency_ms()` (§4.1; ballot spec §11). Still open
(`TODO:`, tracked in §13): (3) the panel term: draws use the epoch-boundary
pulse once per term (default 7 d), not at every epoch (§4.14.7), an owner
question (ballot spec §11); (6) the G2 segments that place ballot closures
(rank 4) and openings (rank 5) after the other transitions, the capacity rule
of G2c and the positions they give `s0` (§4.7.2), which the ballot spec
delegates to this revision (ballot spec §8).

### 10.2 Launch gate

`RegisterRoute` requires both of the following. Each is a stub that returns
`false` until its owner lands it (`TODO:`):

- `parliament_binding_ballot_available()`, provided by the Parliament
  workstream: true once the qualified post-quantum ballot construction is
  active on the chain (ballot spec §5);
- `sccp_reconciliation_available()`, provided by SCCP: true once reconciliation
  of quarantined revisions (§4.10) is implemented.

While `parliament_binding_ballot_available()` is false:

- `ProposeSccpRouteGovernance` is refused for every SCCP action with
  `ParliamentBallotUnavailable`. There is no interim governance, and the SCCP
  parameters keep their genesis values (§4.1).
- `RegisterRoute` cannot be enacted (§4.14.3 P0).
- Genesis and Kagami create no routes: `InitializeSccpV1` creates only the
  parameters, the per-network escrows and generation 1.
- SCCP machinery that needs no route still runs: generations, heartbeats,
  finality headers, keepalives, anchors, the liability clock, forgery evidence
  and panel draws. Endorsements are refused anyway while no route exists
  (§4.14.7 precondition 1).

### 10.3 Trust statement

Binding juries use anonymous on-chain ballots: one-time hash credentials
registered at seat acceptance, a frozen roster Merkle root, and a public vote
with a nullifier and a post-quantum zero-knowledge membership proof; counts are
public (`specs/parliament_private_ballot_design.md`). There is no Parliament
key and no custodian of any kind. **Destinations need no Parliament key.** A
valid control proof shows that `q = n − f` members of the destination's current
generation signed Commit for `(h, R_h)`. At least `f + 1` honest validators
therefore executed block `h`, whose block-start pass validated the certificate,
compared and set the head, applied the effect and wrote the leaf. "The
Parliament enacted this at `h`" holds exactly when Taira is safe.

### 10.4 Profiles and the frozen surface

- **Inbound:** light-client source profiles become active only through
  Parliament enactment (`ActivateLightClientProfile`, §4.13.2).
- **Outbound:** any change to the frozen external verification surface (`X`
  layout, consensus suite, Commit preimage; §3.8) requires a new route revision
  with new contracts, activated by the Parliament. Old revisions drain through
  voids.

## 11. Tests and fixtures

Shared vectors live in `fixtures/sccp/` and `fixtures/crypto/`. Rust generates
them (the TON StateInit vectors come from the contracts themselves),
`scripts/sccp_reference/*.py` re-derives every contract-visible vector
independently, and contract, node and SDK tests consume them. CI regenerates
every vector file and fails on drift or on any difference from the Python
re-derivation.

### 11.1 Fixtures

| Fixture | Content |
|---|---|
| `payload_v1.json` | payloads for all 6 directions (with `deadline_ms`), payload hashes, message ids, amount-scale conversions, rejected encodings (including the retired TRON domain and codec 5) |

| `history_v1.json` | history leaves, roots and paths for sizes 1..=40; peak-bagging equivalence |
| `governance_v1.json` | `SccpGovernanceProposalV1` frames with `base_revisions`, subject sets (including `FastHold`, `FastPauseControl` and `ForgeryHold`), proposal ids, expected heads (`subject_id`, `version`, `head_root`) for fixed revision maps |
| `finality_v1.json` | `X` encodings (rotation, heartbeat, non-rotation, inactive), `R`, `checkpoint_id`, `P`, `m`, `QC_FIXED`, committee roots, anchor leaves, nodes and chunk roots, the forgery evidence id (§11.2); full certificates (§11.3) |
| `committee_transitions_v1.json` | the §5.1.2 state machine as `(state, input, now) → (state', outcome, event)` rows (below) |
| `fast_pause_v1.json` | panel draws, seat replacement, endorsement rounds, certification, enactment, renewal, lift, suspension and lapse rows (below) |
| `forgery_evidence_v1.json`, `liability_v1.json` | the §4.8–§4.9 rows (below) |
| `evm_calldata_v1.json` | golden calldata of every §5.2.2 entry point, every selector and event topic, the view returns, `SccpTransferToTaira`, `SccpVoided` and `SccpCertificate` logs, the P4 CREATE2 address of a sample pin, and `calldata_conformance`: the shared table of `transferToTaira` and `voidFrozen` encodings (canonical, trailing byte and word, truncation, a dirty high bit in every integer field, every dynamic offset moved past an inserted word, nonzero padding of every `bytes`, recipient length and amount bounds, `voidFrozen` counts 0/1/256/257 and the `2^64` end) with the Rust decoder's and the contract's verdicts, which accept exactly the same entries |
| `ton_boc_v1.json`, `ton_stateinit_v1.json` | BoCs of every §5.3.3 op, including `sccp_checkpoint` with and without `next_keys` and `sccp_retry`; snake-cell negatives; canonical minter initial data with an empty `retries` and the minter address for a fixed pin, `NetworkId`, `I`, revision, cap and code refs |

| `rpc/{eth,bsc,ton}/` | captured public-RPC responses for real mainnet blocks, driving the proof builders and verifiers: finality, ancestry and inclusion. The recorded TON liteserver answers (`rpc/ton/transport`) also replay through the TON light client: a key-block bootstrap, the config-28 shuffle against real headers' subset hashes, Simplex signatures of a block and of a key-block hop, and header, shard and transaction proofs that prune `state_update` |
| `fixtures/crypto/bls_consensus_v1.json` | `Sign`, `Verify`, `FastAggregateVerify` and `AggregateVerify` under `DST_SIG` over SHA-256 digests; imported Ethereum `bls12-381-tests`; each allowlist row positive, plus off-by-one lengths and wrong kinds; pinned w3f PoP vectors (algorithm unchanged); negatives: a w3f-transcript signature over a consensus digest, a `DST_SIG` signature presented to the generic API, a PoP used as a signature, the identity key, non-canonical and non-subgroup points |

`eip712_v1.json` and `roster_v1.json` are deleted with the attestation
transport.

**Required `committee_transitions_v1.json` rows:** the initial pin; a
checkpoint that raises `high` and leaves `untilMs` unchanged; a rotation at a
key change; a heartbeat rotation with an identical root (TON without
`next_keys`); a rotation with a lowered `validity_ms`; a rotation whose
successor deadline has already passed (applied, then `Frozen`, processing
stops); 16 batched rotations; K→K′→K; one future-dated certificate replayed
across several validity periods (no extension); freshly forged in-generation
heights after the genuine end (accepted, bounded), then the genuine handoff
latching through V3; after every genuine rotation is applied, certificates of
an old generation refused with `CommitteeNotAccepted` and no state change; a
CUR certificate at `height ≤ high`; V1, V2 and V3, each positive and with its
nearest non-violating neighbour (V1's neighbour is the same `X` with a
different `result_body`, which records nothing and does not latch); expiry,
then refusal of `submitCheckpoints`, then `voidFrozen`; a latch inside a batch;
an inline V3 giving `LatchRequired`, then `submitCheckpoints` latching; a
future-dated rotation `X` (`t_eff` caps the start at `now_ms`); TON checkpoint
eviction ordering.

**Required `fast_pause_v1.json` rows:** a Parliament pause, then a fast pause,
then the lapse (destination and Taira stay paused); a fast round certified
before a Parliament pause and enacted after it (the lapse leaves the Parliament
pause in force); a track-2 leaf delivered after its expiry (no pause); a
Parliament lift with `s0` after `enacted_at` (cleared) and before it
(retained); a ballot opened at position 2 and a fast pause enacted at position
5 of the same block (retained); a Parliament pause, a resume ballot opening, a
fast pause enactment, then the older resume's enactment (Taira part retained,
settlement held); an `InboundOnly` revision whose settlement and refunds a fast
pause holds; a renewal round opened at `until_ms − fast_pause_renew_lead_ms`
and enacted before the lapse, with a lift whose `s0` lies between the two
enactments (renewed pause retained); three primary members silent and the
backup deciding, with the other round deleted at enactment; seat replacement at
`accept_until_ms` from the reserve, reserve exhaustion, and a reserve member's
premature endorsement not counting; quorum reached but the next block after
`closes_at_ms` (`NoResult`); a citizen endorser suspended by a Parliament
enactment earlier in the same pass (`NoResult`); `SetFastPauseSuspended`
enacted earlier in the same pass (`NoResult`), with its duration counted from
its own enactment; a stale nonce; the `MAX_FAST_PAUSE_MS` clamp; an endorsement
by a non-member; a second endorsement by one member; a new draw between quorum
and certification (`NoResult`).

**Required `forgery_evidence_v1.json` rows:** E0–E4 positives, including a
genuine `X` with a different `D_body` (E4) and a certificate completing stray
Commit votes on a block that never committed (E3); `NotEvidence` neighbours: a
genuine certificate, and a genuine certificate with a different valid signer
set; anchors from the tip, the open chunk, and a completed chunk with a path,
with negatives for a missing witness, a wrong path and a pruned chunk;
deduplication with the same and with different signer sets; a pruned
generation, an inactive `X`, and an `ACTIVE` `X` at a degraded height (E4); a
self-contained record whose offence height is `start_height` and whose
offenders carry G6 bindings.

**Required `liability_v1.json` rows:** the liability clock across a halt;
`liable(g)` across the time leg, the destination-progress leg and the cap; L5
with a stalled light client; evidence and an unbond in one block at `lc =
liable_until_lc`, in both orders; pruning that skips a generation named by a
pending record; P2 across a validity reduction.

Keys are `sk_i = KeyGen(IKM = SHA-256("sccp-finality-test-ikm" ‖ u8 i))`,
committees `n = 4, 7, 31`, and signer sets the lowest `q`, the highest `q` and
scattered sets including {0, 9, 30} at `n = 31`. The file also carries a
key-change rotation certificate, a heartbeat rotation certificate (`next =
committee root`), non-rotation certificates with `attest = 0` and `attest = 1`,
a rotation with `attest = 0` (a positive), and an inactive `X`. Negatives, each
mapped to its §5.2.2 error: kind `0x02`; popcount `q ± 1`; spare bits; `attest
= 2`; wrong `I`; wrong network; each of X1–X7 violated (including `ROTATION`
with `validity_ms = 0`, and non-`ROTATION` with a nonzero `validity_ms` or
`next_committee_root`); root mismatch; a certificate of a past generation
(`CommitteeNotAccepted`); flag `0xc0`; wrong sign bit; `y ≥ p`; off-curve `y`;
`σ` outside the subgroup; `σ = 0`; any `σ` limb `≥ p`; `c0`/`c1` swapped; a
w3f-transcript signature; raw-bitmap `signers`; `X.height ≠` the signed height.

### 11.4 Conformance

1. Rust `iroha_sccp::v1::{finality, committee, evidence}` and
   `iroha_crypto::bls::consensus` are the reference.
2. `scripts/sccp_reference/*.py` (`py_ecc` `G2ProofOfPossession` for `DST_SIG`,
   an independent Keccak) re-derives every contract-visible vector and the
   anchor vectors.
3. **The Solidity EDR harness** (Prague) runs every calldata vector,
   certificate and scenario, including dirty-memory runs (memory pre-filled
   before verification) for `n ∈ {4, 7, 31}` and 16-certificate batches. It
   checks that `SccpCertificate` is emitted exactly on the full path, and
   records gas per §5.4 row and hardfork.
4. **The Tolk Acton harness** runs every BoC, certificate and scenario. It pins
   the `DUP TLEN UNTUPLEVAR BLS_FASTAGGREGATEVERIFY` stack shape and gas at `n
   = 4, 7, 31`; the value-before-verify ordering and latch refunds; a bounced
   mint whose unconsume also bounces, recorded in `retries` and recovered by
   `sccp_retry`; and a 10 000-rotation run whose account cell count stays
   constant.
5. One shared table (certificate, scenario → expected outcome name) drives
   Rust, EDR and Acton.
6. `BlsCrypto` and `ProofCrypto` parity: one shared certificate verifies
   identically through both.
7. **`integration_tests/tests/sccp_lanes`** runs 4 peers through: an epoch
   boundary with a key change; an idle period crossing a heartbeat, with a
   keepalive; a fast pause on an idle chain (seat acceptance, endorsements,
   keepalive, certification and enactment, then the lapse with no block); a
   forged certificate signed by a test quorum of an earlier generation,
   submitted as evidence with an anchor witness (record, per-revision hold, and
   the penalty after the slashing delay); and a Parliament attestation that
   releases the hold. It extracts bundles from Torii, verifies them with the
   reference, and replays them into EDR and Acton: finalize, rotation,
   heartbeat, control, void and latch.

### 11.5 Required tests

- **Rust unit tests** for every new or modified function: codecs and amount
  conversion, digests, transfer and control leaves, Merkle and history, `X`
  parsing and `result_of_preimage`, committee roots, generation rules S0, A1
  and G1–G7 (including a degraded boundary followed by a resync), anchors and
  chunk paths, the liability clock and `liable(g)`, E0–E4, every rule of the
  §4.1 parameter table including the joint ones and each boundary value, the
  governance subject mapping and expected head, the SCCP arm of the exact-JSON
  `u64` invariant, and every validation branch of each ISI and governance
  action, including `ActivateLightClientProfile`: its binary and JSON roundtrip
  and fixed layout; enactment recording a compiled version from the next block,
  and refusing a version that does not exceed the newest recorded one or a hash
  that differs from the compiled profile; deferral (not refusal) when the
  release does not compile the version; the digest unchanged when a release
  appends a version that is not activated; verification switching profiles at
  the activation height; blocks before the activation resolving the same
  profiles under the new release as under the old one; and the p2p handshake
  policy unchanged by an activation. The light clients additionally test BSC
  roster keys validated once per learned set and the newest set's freshness
  moving only at re-announcing epoch checkpoints; a TON transfer event whose
  amount, nonce or sender disagrees with its payload; and
  `InstallTrustedCheckpoint` refused for TON.
- **Node (irohad) tests:** keeper-key generation into an empty `key_dir`
  (modes, atomic write, refusal of symlinks); `[sccp.keeper]` and
  `[sccp.light_client_keeper]` defaults parsing with an empty config and the
  compiled endpoint lists; a keeper whose endpoint hangs does not delay the
  other networks or keepalives; per-network cadence, backoff and the skipping
  of frozen or aged light clients; keepalive stagger; the watch building
  evidence from a published certificate alone; the L1 start-up refusal.
- **Review-driven tests:** a future-dated certificate replayed across several
  validity periods, then freshly forged heights (no extension, V3 latch); every
  genuine rotation applied, then an old quorum compromised (its certificates
  refused, Taira's evidence slashes it); both Parliament/fast-pause enactment
  orders, suspension races and delayed pause delivery after the lapse; the TON
  wrapper at `n = 4, 7, 31` plus the rotation-count run; the Rust/EVM/TON
  cross-check (exact quorum, bitmap order, PoP-admitted keys, cross-suite
  rejection, infinity and subgroup cases, dirty-memory hash-to-G2); a PrepareQC
  formed by others while this node answers `ClockAhead` (no Prepare of its own;
  Commit only on the others' PrepareQC); recovery from a future proposal;
  idle-chain heartbeat, enactment and fast-pause keepalives; the 31-seat result
  body; a genuine certificate fetched from `/v1/bridge/finality/{H}` is
  `NotEvidence`, and a genuine `X` with a forged `D_body` is E4; a hidden
  PrepareQC on a due-work block for longer than `gov.due_work_max_lag_ms`, then
  a re-proposal that commits; a BSC halt with backdated resumption after the
  time leg (`g` stays liable until L5 clears, and the forged rotation is
  slashed); a Taira halt past `liable_until_lc`, then a time jump (evidence
  admitted and the unbond refused in the same block); evidence near expiry
  across pruning and restart; a past pin, then an intermediate generation with
  shortened validity, then catch-up (P2 refuses); a captured `InboundOnly`
  revision, attestation of the other revisions, then attacker burns (the
  captured revision stays quarantined); a forged certificate through an
  internal EVM call (`SccpCertificate` carries it, and the keeper builds
  evidence from the event alone); skewed honest clocks (two at `T + d`, one at
  `T`) around a ballot opening (the bound is `2d`); a degraded epoch boundary,
  then a resync generation.
- **Governance clock (§4.7.2):** with `K` casting windows open, a closure and
  an opening due in one pass (the closure frees the slot and the opening takes
  it in the same pass); a deferred opening that takes its `s0` at the pass that
  opens it; a closure anchored at `t(h_open + 1) + casting_window_ms` for an
  opening block committed after a long commit lag; a ballot opening and a
  fast-pause enactment in one pass (the opening has the smaller position, so
  that ballot's resume retains the pause); a pass whose budget defers items
  (order kept, leftovers due, the keepalive due again).
- **Reconciliation (§4.10):** the phases Held, Reconciling and Reconciled; a
  forged-mint proof in the last block before `closes_at_ms` (counted) and at it
  (refused); `rho` with `B + F = 0`; payouts that sum to exactly `B` over `B +
  F` of face value in two different claim orders; a claim beyond `B + F` capped
  by the remaining liability; a pending refund that claims never consume; a
  bounce that would target a quarantined revision strands; `RecordSccpMessage`
  refused after reconciliation; `RetireRevision` refused before the window
  end; a second `OpenSccpReconciliation` refused; a claim kept `Pending` by a
  refused credit leaves `S` and `liability(r)` unchanged and its retry pays
  from the later `S`; a zero payout releases with no credit, fee or bounce; a
  forged-mint proof that would make `liability(r) + F` overflow `u128` is
  refused; a claim of a Reconciled revision is no longer held by forgery
  evidence recorded after the window end.
- **Core integration tests (4 peers):** the chain `RecordSccpMessage → commit →
  X → /v1/sccp/messages/{id}/proof`, verified by the wallet crate, including a
  failed record in the same block; escrow and liability invariants, including
  the definition-owner burn and permissioned transfer negatives and front-run
  registration of an escrow id; inbound (prove with the revision paused, then
  settle; self-claim from a zero-balance unregistered recipient; bounce onto
  the `Bidirectional` revision; liability shortfall); outbound (void proof and
  refund, a voided bounce going to `stranded`, and `ReleaseStranded`);
  governance through the real Parliament harness with the recommended `[gov]`
  profile (a route bundle enacted end to end once the launch gate stub is
  enabled for the test; attempts created and advanced by an account without
  `CanManageParliament`, and manager transitions with non-canonical content
  rejected; proposals on disjoint subjects enacted in either order without
  supersession; a pause proposal and a concurrent `SwitchRevision` on the same
  route, where whichever enacts second is `Superseded`; a stale
  `base_revisions` refusing attempt creation; pause, resume and pause again as
  three distinct proposals; `SetTairaPaused` ensure semantics after a frozen
  void; `SetDestinationPaused` on a revision retired in between; a retry
  attempt after `Rejected` succeeding and one after `Superseded` failing; an
  identical re-proposal after `ExecutionFailed` refused; `ExecutionFailed` with
  no state change when a precondition fails at enactment; the proposer rule and
  the `OnlyGenesis` grant rule; no direct path; every SCCP proposal refused
  while the gate is closed); controls (an enacted `SetDestinationPaused`
  produces a control leaf in the enacting block, the proof bundle verifies in
  the wallet crate and `applyControl` succeeds on EDR; `RecordSccpMessage` is
  refused while the destination is paused or the revision is held); `enabled =
  false` behavior; TON and EVM `RegisterRoute` address recomputation, and a
  pinned generation older than the current one.
- **Inbound:** per-chain positive proofs from captured mainnet data; Ethereum
  negatives (fewer than 342 participants, missing finality branch, slot
  ordering, wrong fork version); HeaderChain, HistoryContract window edges, and
  Backfill; BSC skipping across a set change; TON skipped key block and a shard
  walk across split and merge; equivocation freeze, weak-subjectivity
  rejection, fork-bound rejection under the active profile version (and
  acceptance once an extending version is activated, with no re-initialization,
  while a release that lacks that version fails closed); the checkpoint stride
  retention rule.
- **Contracts:** EDR (EVM) and Acton (TON) suites for every §5 rule: the
  committee state machine rows; deadline edges; `voidExpired` and `voidFrozen`
  range and revert rules, including `voidFrozen` after a latch; cap, bitmap
  word boundaries, bucket boundaries and bucket activation (a bucket deployed
  early by a stranger, and one redeployed by a third party after deletion);
  bounced consume, bounced internal transfer and unconsume, a failed
  `sccp_consumed` or `sccp_already_consumed`, recorded retries, and a mint in
  flight across a latch; TON value safety (burns and controls below
  `MINTER_FLOOR`, quotes taken before time advances, an event that cannot be
  sent); plain-burn rejection, the workchain rejection, and the
  canonical-calldata rejections of `transferToTaira` and `voidFrozen`, driven
  by `calldata_conformance`; `applyControl` (both tracks, stale and equal
  nonces rejected, a nonce gap accepted, a checkpoint-based control, the
  fast-pause expiry and clamp, a control leaf of another network, destination,
  revision or Taira network rejected, a transfer leaf offered as a control
  rejected, and burns, checkpoints and voids open while paused); immutables,
  `opCount`, `controlNonce = 0` and `sccp_init`. Measured gas is recorded
  against §5.4.
- **ABI goldens:** the syscall `0xA0` argument text in
  `crates/ivm/spec/syscalls.toml`, the generated
  `crates/ivm_abi/src/syscalls_doc_gen.rs` and `crates/ivm/docs/syscalls.md`
  name only the `1=SubmitBallot` operation tag (§4.4), and `ivm_abi` defines no
  tag-2 constant. The ABI v1 hash golden in
  `crates/ivm/tests/abi_hash_versions.rs` and every committed `.to` fixture and
  manifest carry the hash of that surface. Syscall numbering and
  `abi_syscall_list_golden.rs` are unchanged.
- **Signed-only outbound record (§4.4):** both IVM hosts (`CoreHost` and the
  mock `WsvHost`) reject an encoded `RecordSccpMessage` under tags 0, 1, 2 and
  others with an empty queue; `CREATE_TRIGGER` in a generic and a contract
  frame, a signed user trigger registration, a raw IVM program, a supplied
  `IvmProved` replay and a trigger's instruction group cannot derive it; a
  top-level signed record succeeds as an `Instructions` executable and as a
  `Batch` item; a multisig proposal records from the multisig account once
  signed approval transactions reach quorum (also through the complete
  transaction executor), while an opaque proposal or approval of it is refused.

### 11.6 Mutation gate

The Core mutation gate (`scripts/sumeragi_mutation_gate.py --core`) carries the
SCCP and certified-time entries HC133–HC157, and the sans-IO core and simulator
gate carries MS51 and MS52. HC100–HC132 are other Core entries; earlier drafts of this design used
HC100–HC124 for the rows below, and those ids are retired. `specs/sumeragi.md`
§13.4 is authoritative for each row's mutation, named killing test and oracle.
The rows map to the rules of this spec as follows:

| Rule (this spec) | Gate entries | Lands with |
|---|---|---|
| `R` binds `X` (§3.6); G5 boundary header fields (§4.2.2) | HC133; HC134, HC135 | Team C (WP-C5) |
| Consensus signing through the consensus API (§3.8) | HC136 | Team C (WP-C5) |
| CT1, CT3 and CT5 (§4.3); the simulator's model of CT1 | HC137, HC138, HC144; MS52 | Team C (WP-C5) |
| `Execute.certified`: the executor's use, and the core's emission (§4.3) | HC149; MS51 | Team C (WP-C5) |
| L3 release gate; liability clock step cap (§4.8) | HC147; HC151 | Team C (WP-C5) |
| Self-contained penalty record: offence height and G6 offenders (§4.9 step 9) | HC153 | Team C (WP-C5) |
| Due predicate: heartbeat leg, governance leg, degraded run (§4.7.3) | HC139, HC140, HC154 | Team S (WP-S3; HC140's killing test also needs the fast pause of WP-S5) |
| K1, K2 (§4.7.4) | HC141, HC148 | Team S (WP-S3) |
| G4 missing inputs never `Invalid`; G2 `BEAT`; G7 resync (§4.2.2, §4.6) | HC142, HC143, HC155 | Team S (WP-S2) |
| E4, E0, E3 (§4.9) | HC145, HC146, HC150 | Team S (WP-S6) |
| L5 destination-progress gate (§4.8) | HC152 | Team S (WP-S6) |
| Pruning skips generations named by pending records (§4.11) | HC156 | Team S (WP-S2) |
| Per-revision forgery hold keyed on `forgery_floor` (§4.10) | HC157 | Team S (WP-S10) |

Format pins owned by `iroha_data_model` and `iroha_crypto` are enforced by the
§11 golden tests in normal CI. Liveness tests that fail before their change and
pass after it: `idle_chain_certifies_heartbeat_within_interval` (fake clock),
`clock_guard_liveness_with_f_plus_one_slow_clocks`,
`missing_pulse_does_not_make_keepalive_due`,
`f33_hidden_prepareqc_due_work_block_commits_after_lag` and
`missed_boundary_resyncs_generation`.

**Rules without a gate entry yet** (`TODO:` Team S; the `specs/sumeragi.md`
owner assigns the next free ids after HC157): the fast-pause lift rule
(§4.14.7), the pass order and positions of §4.7.2 (closures before openings, G2
before G3), the panel draw's registering no pulse demand (§4.14.7), the
certification and enactment rechecks of a fast pause (§4.14.7), and the
reconciliation payout and phase rules (§4.10 R3–R5). Each needs a named
deterministic killing test before its rule lands.

## 12. Phasing and implementation status

This revision is the implementation baseline. "Implemented" means present in
the candidate tree with tests; it does not mean qualified, and every
implemented item is re-validated once the workspace builds again. "TODO" means
specified here and not yet implemented; implementations carry `TODO:` markers
until it lands.

| Area | Status |
|---|---|
| Payload codec, amounts, transfer leaf, commitment tree, history accumulator (§3.1–§3.5) | Implemented. The control leaf is still the previous 126-byte single-flag layout; the 199-byte v1 leaf (§3.4) is TODO |
| `RecordSccpMessage`, signed-only execution and the ABI closure for contract-originated sends (§4.4) | Implemented. The hold check of step 1 and the degraded refusal of step 2 are TODO (the tree still checks attestation liveness) |
| Inbound prove and settle, self-claim, bounce, holds, liability shortfall, escrow guards, voids, refunds, strands and FASTPQ-bounded refunds (§4.12, §4.15, §4.16) | Implemented. The `Held` reason for forgery holds, quarantine and fast pauses, and reconciliation settlement, are TODO |
| Exempt eligibility predicate and charge-on-failure (§4.19) | Implemented for the current exempt kinds. The classes `Keepalive`, `ForgeryEvidence` and any-authority `KeeperAdvance`, the per-class quotas and R-EX are TODO |
| Light clients for Ethereum, BSC and TON; versioned profiles activated by Parliament enactment; aged-proof builders with backfills; RPC hygiene (§4.13, §8) | Implemented |
| Light-client keeper task | Implemented as `irohad/src/sccp_attestor/keeper.rs`, gated on a bridge key. Its move to `irohad/src/sccp_keeper.rs` with the keeper key, keepalive and watch duties, and the L5 feed, are TODO |
| Parliament SCCP payload, per-subject heads, permissionless core-derived attempts and manager transitions, `OnlyGenesis` grant, `governance drive` (§4.14.3, §4.14.5) | Implemented. The new actions and subjects, `enact` with `s0`, the lift rule, the removal of `ClearBridgeKeyFault`, and the launch gate are TODO |
| Torii read routes for capabilities, registry, messages, outbound, controls, history, light clients and governance (§6) | Implemented on the attestation model. The finality, committee, evidence, anchor, forgery-hold and fast-pause routes, the new bundle types and the removal of roster routes are TODO |
| EVM contract: ERC-20, consumed bitmap, canonical calldata, supply cap (§5.1.4, §5.1.7) | Implemented on the attestation ABI. BLS verification (EIP-2537), the committee state machine, checkpoints, `SccpCertificate`, the v1 control leaf, CREATE2 deployment and the §5.2.2 ABI are TODO |
| TON contracts: value safety, floors, bucket activation, `retries` and `sccp_retry` (§5.3.4–§5.3.5) | Implemented on the attestation layout. BLS verification, the committee state machine and checkpoints, the §5.3 storage, ops and events, and exit codes 433/434 are TODO |
| Consensus signing API and `DST_SIG` (§3.8; `specs/sumeragi.md` §1 item 6) | TODO (WP-C1) |
| Finality header, certified result `R`, `CertifiedResultV1` and every reader (§3.6, §4.6; `specs/sumeragi.md` §4.1.1) | TODO (WP-C2). Its first deliverable is the 31-seat body-size measurement (§13 item 5) |
| Certified time CT1–CT5 and `Execute.certified` (§4.3; `specs/sumeragi.md` §4.5) | TODO (WP-C3) |
| Genesis and Kagami regeneration, including the SCCP staking profile (§4.8 L1) | TODO (WP-C4) |
| Frozen-surface golden test and mutation-gate entries (§11.6) | TODO: Team C lands its entries in WP-C5; Team S adds its entries with the work packages named in §11.6 |
| Self-contained SCCP penalty records, the L3 release gate, the `irohad` L1 refusal (§4.8–§4.9) | TODO (WP-C6) |
| Committee generations, anchors, the `X` producer, degraded and resync paths, pruning (§4.2, §4.5, §4.6, §4.11) | TODO (WP-S2) |
| Shared `Keepalive`, `governance_due`, positions, the millisecond governance clock (§4.7) | TODO (WP-S3), coordinated with the Parliament workstream |
| Control leaf v1 and the separated pause state (§3.4, §4.14.6) | TODO (WP-S4) |
| Fast pause track (§4.14.7) | TODO (WP-S5) |
| Liability clock, L5, forgery evidence, L1 parameter checks (§4.8–§4.9) | TODO (WP-S6) |
| Per-revision holds, attestation, quarantine and reconciliation (§4.10) | TODO (WP-S10); reconciliation is a launch blocker |
| Launch gates (§10.2) | TODO (WP-S9): both stubs return `false` |
| `specs/governance_pipeline.md`: the fast pause track, governance clock, keepalive and launch-gate sections that SCCP owns | Written ("SCCP-owned governance mechanisms"); their implementation is the work packages above. The ballot sections belong to the Parliament workstream |
| Deletions still in the tree | TODO: bridge keys, attestations, subjects, attestation pruning, faults and rosters (`iroha_core`, `iroha_data_model`); the attestor (`irohad/src/sccp_attestor*`, `[sccp.attestor]`); EIP-712, secp256k1 and roster code in `iroha_sccp` and both contracts; the heartbeat marker and the SCCP part of `deterministic_start_work_pending`; the fixtures `eip712_v1.json` and `roster_v1.json`; and TRON everywhere (the `SccpNetworkV1` variant, constants, light client, RPC builders, wallet, CLI, `[zk.sccp]` limits, contract tooling and fixtures) |
| Parliament post-quantum ballot (`specs/parliament_private_ballot_design.md`) | External dependency: specified, not implemented or qualified. Launch blocker |

**Order of work.** M0 freezes the interfaces (the consensus API constants and
allowlist; the `CertifiedResultV1` types; the `Execute.certified` API; the
`iroha_sccp::v1` reference with the hash-only vectors and the state-machine,
control, fast-pause and liability rows; the TON wrapper test and exit-code
table; verification of `SCCP_EVM_DEPLOYER` on Ethereum and BSC) and asks the
Parliament workstream to confirm the interface items of §10.1. M1 implements
the core and contract work packages above in parallel. M2 produces
real-certificate vectors, the Torii routes, the rotation archive, `monitor`,
evidence and deployment tooling, gas baselines and the Python re-derivation. M3
runs the 4-peer integration test and the three-way cross-check, rewrites
`status.md` and `roadmap.md` in place, and starts external audits (EIP-2537
glue, the Tolk binding, the consensus transcript change, the `X` producer and
clock guards, anchors and liability, holds and reconciliation). Launch stays
gated on the Parliament ballot and reconciliation (§10.2).

**Later.** SDK parity (§8) and MCP `iroha.*` read tools; destination-state
proofs through the inbound light clients, so that Taira can detect captured or
diverged destinations on chain and automate `AttestSccpDeploymentProgress`;
external custody of consensus vote keys; unifying every BLS signature on RFC
9380 suites; finalizer and claim tips (deferred by decision; a later payload
version, since no backward compatibility is required).

## 13. Open questions

1. **Fast pause panel term (owner question).** The owner decision says panels
   are drawn "per epoch". The 7 d default term draws at the first epoch
   boundary after the term ends, because with 1 h epochs a 20 % attacker would
   expect about 53 captures of either panel a year, enough to keep SCCP paused
   permanently (§4.14.7). The literal reading is the parameter value
   `fast_pause_panel_term_ms` = the epoch duration, and implementations support
   both. Confirm the default.
2. **Parliament interface items.** Items 3 and 6 of §10.1 (the panel term,
   and the G2 segment order of ballot closures and openings with the capacity
   rule and positions) need the Parliament workstream's confirmation before
   the interfaces freeze. Items 1, 2, 4 and 5 were confirmed on 2026-10-05.
3. **Reconciliation (launch blocker).** R1–R6 (§4.10) are normative: the
   quarantine's hold on settlement ends at the window end, later claims settle
   at the fixed rate with the payout of R4, and the quarantine record and the
   outbound refusal never end. Open (Team S): whether the pro-rata rule with a
   proof window is final or a claims bar date replaces it; liability that backs
   genuine messages the captured deployment never minted and that no void can
   reach; and the remaining layouts, routes and tooling.
4. **The Parliament ballot (launch blocker).** `fast_pause_hold_ms` is pinned
   only once the ballot's windows are fixed; if one full-track attempt
   (`parliament_sccp_attempt_latency_ms()`) takes more than about 27 d, SCCP
   cannot be configured and the ballot timings must change (§4.1).
5. **31-seat result body.** A 31-seat boundary with a frozen preparation must
   fit 65 315 body bytes (§3.6). If the measurement fails, the fallback is an
   explicit core change (raise `MAX_RESULT_WITNESS_BYTES` to 65 757 and re-run
   the bound tests and the gate), never a silent one. It blocks the WP-C2
   merge.
6. **Measurements.** Gas and TON costs of §5.4, including `SccpCertificate`,
   and the CI baselines; TON's three checkpoint slots after measuring relayer
   races; generation, anchor and open-chunk storage on a 1 s-cadence chain with
   maximal churn (§4.11).
7. **Attribution under strict liability.** Cross-view equivocation forensics,
   and finer attribution when more than `f` members are Byzantine or honest
   stray Commit votes are reused (§9.12). Evidence ingestion carries a `TODO:`
   for it.
8. **Coverage and settlement delay.** Whether to check route caps against
   `coalition_slashable_floor` at enactment (today Parliament guidance only,
   §9.11), and whether an inbound settlement delay should close the burn race
   window.
9. **Destination-state proofs.** Proving a destination's `committeeState()`
   through the inbound light clients would let Taira detect captured
   deployments on chain and automate progress attestation; not in v1.
10. **Key custody and BLS unification.** External custody of consensus vote
    keys, and unifying every BLS signature on RFC 9380 suites (§3.8).
11. **Genesis staking records.** Genesis validation should assert that every
    genesis peer has a staking record, so that G6 never stores `None` (§4.2.2).
12. **Beacon re-keying.** Every validator-set change needs a new global-beacon
    session before the next pulse (§4.14.5 item 5). Who builds the in-node DKG
    and certificate automation, and the node-generated beacon credential?
13. **Taira decentralization.** Four validators on one host make the `f`-of-`n`
    assumption nominal, and the SCCP staking floor (21 d unbonding) is new for
    Taira's operators. Distributing validators is a deployment decision outside
    this spec.
14. **Real mainnet deployments for inbound fixtures.** Positive inbound tests
    with genuine `SccpTransferToTaira` events need the contracts deployed on
    mainnet and real burns. Until then, inbound verification is tested with
    captured mainnet blocks plus unit-level event binding. Who funds and
    performs the first mainnet deployments?
15. **Public RPC coverage of the default lists** (beacon light-client routes,
    `eth_getBlockReceipts` on BSC, the destination readers of the watch,
    liteserver reliability and retention) is still unverified, and the chosen
    endpoints' terms of use need a check before the lists are compiled in.
16. **Hard-fork cadence.** Ethereum Glamsterdam/Gloas and frequent BSC forks
    each require a release that appends a profile version and a Parliament
    `ActivateLightClientProfile` enacted before the active version's
    `supported_until` (§4.13.2). Every validator must run that release before
    the enactment height, so a full-track round must start well ahead of each
    fork, and the real fork parameters are still needed.
17. **Parameter tuning** needs measurement: 1 d heartbeat, 14 d validity, 7 d
    grace, 30 d progress cap, 7 d outbound TTL, the exempt cap of 32, the fast
    pause panel size, windows and 10 d hold, the self-claim fee,
    `gov.due_work_max_lag_ms`, and TON gas limits per step.
18. **Wrapped test XOR on mainnets** is stranded on every Taira reset. Token
    naming and user disclosure need product sign-off.
19. **`SCCP_EVM_DEPLOYER`.** Confirm that the keyless proxy's runtime code is
    identical on Ethereum and BSC before relying on it (§5.2.1).

## 14. Decisions (binding)

**Decisions of 2026-09-26, as amended by revision 5.**

| # | Decision | Applied in |
|---|---|---|
| D1 | **Governance is the SORA Parliament only**, amended by D12–D13: every SCCP decision goes through `ProposeSccpRouteGovernance` → Parliament bodies with a binding jury → certificate → block-start enactment, with its proposer rule, the `SccpGovernanceProposalV1` payload and expected heads scoped per subject; the only other authority is the pause-only fast pause track. Fault clearing is deleted with the bridge keys | §1.1, §4.14, §9.13, §10 |
| D2 | **Destination pause through control leaves**, amended by D13: no privileged breaker or signed mint-control statement exists. Enacted Parliament pauses (track 1) and fast pauses (track 2) record a 199-byte control leaf carrying the complete pause state in the enacting block's commitment tree; anyone applies the newest one with `applyControl` (`0x32118e92`) or `applyControlFromCheckpoint` (`0x53899b1e`) (TON `sccp_apply_control*`) under a strictly increasing control nonce. Burns, checkpoints, rotations and voids stay open while paused | §3.4, §4.14.6, §4.14.7, §5.1.6 |
| D3 | **Validators come and go at any time**, amended by D11: exit is never blocked, but on a network with SCCP the release of a validator's stake waits until no generation that contained it is liable. There is no handoff signature: the outgoing generation's `CommitQC` of the boundary block is the handoff | §4.2, §4.8 |
| D4 | **Zero-touch validator setup**, amended by D8: no bridge key exists; the node generates only its keeper key, and the keeper is on by default with compiled default public RPC lists. The beacon credential must become node-generated the same way; until then the guarantee covers SCCP only | §4.13.4, §4.14.5, §9.1 |
| D5 | **Approved:** fee exemption for eligible keepalives, forgery evidence, keeper advances and recipient self-claims (advances and self-claims exempt on success and charged on failure; a failing keepalive or forgery evidence makes its block `Invalid`, as amended by D16 and D11); implicit recipient registration; the crates `iroha_sccp_rpc` and `iroha_sccp_wallet` (reqwest + rustls, TON ADNL crypto); default public RPC lists in `iroha_config` | §4.12, §4.19, §8 |
| D6 | **Deferred:** finalizer tips; a later payload version bump is acceptable | §12 |
| D7 | **Networks:** mainnet profiles only, no testnets; amended by D10 to three external networks | preamble, §2 |

**Decisions of 2026-10-04 and 2026-10-05.**

| # | Decision | Applied in |
|---|---|---|
| D8 | **No dedicated bridge keys** (2026-10-05). Destinations (Ethereum and BSC through EIP-2537; TON through native BLS opcodes) verify Taira's Sumeragi `CommitQC` (exactly `q = n − f` signers of a `3f + 1` committee, `4 ≤ n ≤ 31`) with a fixed-layout header `X` bound into the certified result `R`. Bridge keys, attestation transactions, attestation fault evidence and the attestor are deleted; the inbound light-client keeper is kept | §1, §3.6–§3.8, §4.2–§4.6, §5 |
| D9 | **BLS integrator scope** (2026-10-05). Only Sumeragi consensus votes (kinds `0x01`–`0x05`) and RS16 availability statements move to the IETF min-pk PoP ciphersuite (`DST_SIG`, message `SHA-256` of the allowlisted preimage) through a dedicated consensus API; every other BLS signature keeps the w3f transcript for now (`TODO:` unify later); consensus-key rogue-key protection keeps the w3f proof of possession. No peer key-consent signature in this release | §3.8, §9.3, §9.5; `specs/sumeragi.md` §1 item 6 |
| D10 | **TRON is removed** from SCCP v1 entirely (2026-10-05) | preamble, §2, §3, §4.13, §5, §11, §12 |
| D11 | **Exit delay plus slashing** (2026-10-05). Validators of a network with SCCP stay bonded and slashable for at least the destination validity window after leaving the committee, enforced at genesis and at parameter validation. Any `CommitQC`-valid certificate of a committee generation for a Taira commit preimage whose block or result does not match Taira's committed chain at that height is slashing evidence against every signer when presented on Taira, through the consensus penalty pipeline. Destination expiry is anchored so that identical or stale certificates never extend it | §4.2.3, §4.8–§4.10, §5.1.2, §9 |
| D12 | **Parliament with no key and no custodian** (2026-10-05). Binding juries use anonymous on-chain ballots (one-time hash credentials, a frozen roster Merkle root, a public vote plus nullifier plus post-quantum ZK membership proof; counts public) per `specs/parliament_private_ballot_design.md`. SCCP consumes only the 32-byte certificate id and `effect_preimage_hash` (and the ballot's `s0` anchor for the lift rule); enactment is a deterministic block-start step. Trust wording: "destinations need no Parliament key" | §4.14.3, §4.14.5, §10 |
| D13 | **Fast pause track** (pause-only track chosen 2026-10-04; standing panel 2026-10-05). Pause-only; a standing panel and a disjoint backup drawn per epoch outside the attempt reducer, with no new consensus-mandatory pulse slot; public account-signed endorsements; automatic failover to the backup; automatic lapse; separate Parliament-pause and fast-pause state. Applied with either panel deciding (which makes failover unconditional), seat acceptance with a reserve, renewal before lapse, and the per-epoch draw as the parameter value `fast_pause_panel_term_ms` = the epoch duration, with a 7 d default awaiting owner confirmation (§13 item 1) | §4.14.7 |
| D14 | **Light-client profile versions are activated by Parliament enactment** (2026-10-05; already implemented) | §4.13.2 |
| D15 | **SCCP launch waits for the Parliament** (2026-10-05): no route is registered until the post-quantum Parliament ballot exists; no interim governance; no genesis-seeded routes | §4.1, §10.2 |
| D16 | **Idle chains create no empty blocks** (2026-10-05): a permissionless, due-gated keepalive produces the blocks heartbeats and governance work need | §4.7 |
| D17 | **Cross-workstream agreement** (2026-10-04). SCCP owns the enactment proof (control leaf), the fast pause pipeline and the `governance_due` predicate with the block-start clock that the keepalive uses; the Parliament workstream owns the ballot; the standing panel is drawn outside the attempt reducer and registers no Parliament pulse demand; a missing pulse leaves the previous panel seated; the lift rule keys on the binding ballot's `s0`; the hold lifetime covers the full track with retries; re-pause has no cooldown. Applied with the hold rule amended on 2026-10-05: the ballot has no ballot retries, so the hold covers one full-track attempt (`parliament_sccp_attempt_latency_ms()`, ballot spec §11), and renewal before the lapse covers longer outages | §4.1, §4.7, §4.14.6, §4.14.7, §10.1 |
| D18 | **Cross-workstream agreement** (2026-10-05). The certificate interface is unchanged by the ballot decision; citizenship bonds are independent of validator staking (SCCP's exit delay and slashing live in the staking module); the Prepare-vote clock guard is specified normatively in `specs/sumeragi.md`, `max_clock_drift_ms` is a committed chain parameter capped at 60 000 ms, and the residual early firing of deadlines is stated explicitly. Applied with the residual corrected from the agreed `max_clock_drift_ms` to `2·max_clock_drift_ms` relative to an individual honest clock, which the Parliament workstream confirmed on 2026-10-05 (§10.1 item 5; ballot spec §3.4) | §4.1, §4.3, §4.14.5; `specs/sumeragi.md` §4.5 |

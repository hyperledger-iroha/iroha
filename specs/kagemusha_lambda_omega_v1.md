# KAGEMUSHA Λ and Ω proof construction V1

Status: design record, 2026-10-05, for [proposal](kagemusha_single_design_proposal.md)
revision 2026-10-05 and the [wallet wire record](kagemusha_wallet_wire_v1.md). It fixes how
the lineage relation Λ and its transport form Ω are proved on [PIPA-v1](plonk_ipa_v1.md):
circuit kinds, accumulation, the Ω bytes, the receiver's native work, per-operation budgets,
memory, the soundness argument, the gadget set and milestones M3–M5. The proposal and the
wire record govern protocol semantics and encodings; this record governs the proof
construction. It applies the third set of owner answers of 2026-10-05 (B1–B8, §1.1), which
the proposal and the wire record now carry (§12). Only the k12 step proofs σ exist.
Everything else here is unbuilt, and every figure carries a label:

- **[M]** measured with the native engine on the shared Apple-silicon Mac (20 CPUs, timings
  ±25%), or where stated in the [checklist](kagemusha_evidence_gate.md) §8;
- **[E]** estimated from the unit costs of §5.3 and the counts of §5.2;
- **[C]** exact arithmetic (the PIPA §7 byte formula, a lattice reduction), not a measurement;
- **[S]** read from source or spec text.

The thresholds of §10 select design fallbacks (for example the A-split of §2.8). They are
engineering checks, not release approvals.

Notation follows proposal §3 (σ, Λ, Ω, τ, folded head, decide, deferred values). Pallas has
base field Fp and scalar field Fq; Vesta has base field Fq and scalar field Fp; p < q < 2p
and q − p ≈ 2^86.16 [C]. A Vesta proof comes from an Fp circuit and has Fq commitment
coordinates; a Pallas proof comes from an Fq circuit and has Fp coordinates. `P` is RP57
Poseidon over Fp (proposal §3); `P_Fq` is the same construction over Fq, already pinned in
`iroha_pasta::poseidon` (`RP57_FQ`). "PIPA §" means `plonk_ipa_v1.md` and "wire §" the wire
record.

## 1. Decisions and constraints

### 1.1 Owner decisions applied

| Decision (2026-10-05) | Effect on Λ and Ω |
|---|---|
| Every protocol P-256 signature signs the 32-byte canonical encoding of the body's `P_bytes` signing message with SHA256withECDSA (proposal §3, wire §1) | Each in-circuit ECDSA needs exactly one SHA-256 compression block, in the same Q slot as the ECDSA |
| Every wallet map and the lineage-level credit-digest tree is a depth-32 Poseidon indexed Merkle tree (IMT, wire §3.2), except the B5 quota-usage array | One IMT chip; there is no sparse-Merkle-tree chip |
| **OQ-1 (B1), applied.** Every digest Λ recomputes is Poseidon: `operation_id`, the unload nullifier, the request, receipt, package, credential, certificate, voucher, fee-schedule and policy object digests, the certificate-set digest, and the receipt's statement digest. `H` remains only for `scheme_id`, the enrollment and renewal transcripts, `account`, the marker, the output descriptor and the artifact digests | Λ computes no SHA-256 beyond one block per signature. Identities Λ only carries (`wallet_id`, `enrollment_id`, asset scope, `relation_id`, verifying-key set) are never recomputed in-circuit (scope question, wire §7). Encodings (wire §§1, 3.2): an object digest is `P(d_obj, [m, r_lo, r_hi, s_lo, s_hi])` (3 permutations); the package digest has 3 elements (2), `operation_id` 4 or 5 (3), the nullifier 5 (3); the statement digest is the σ statement digest, 26 elements (14) |
| **OQ-2 (B2), applied.** Λ_recv and Λ_archive may fold a self-computed *corrected claim* (G*, u), with G* = ⟨s(u), g⟩ ≠ G, as the witness that an incoming accumulator (G, u) fails to decide | §2.7 burn and no-op branches |
| **OQ-3 (B3), applied.** On the burn branch with a duplicate `credit_id`, the committed consumed-credit root equals the predecessor's root or is a structurally valid IMT insert of a fresh key | §2.7 |
| **OQ-4 (B4), applied.** The QuotaShare refresh rule "keeps the end of every existing usage key" is checked only for the 64 quota-window slots | §5.1; with B5 it is part of the usage-array rebuild, whose budget §5.4 states |
| **B5.** The quota-usage map is a depth-6 fixed array aligned one to one with the 64 quota-window slots; a Send charges its window slots in place | σ_send: ≈ 45 permutations per charge, ≈ 309 for the quota part and ≈ 346 with every control [E], a single-lane k14 shape (≈ 3,424 B [C]) or k13 with shared paths, replacing the k15 IMT estimate. Λ_refresh(QuotaShare): array rebuild ≈ 954 permutations instead of ≈ 4,734; no A-split (§§5.1, 5.4) |
| **B6.** The Request records the receiver blacklist version and root used at issuance; Receive (native and σ_recv) checks only that list | σ_recv proves the gap in the recorded root and its key is selected by the recorded version. Λ_recv looks the recorded pair up in the blacklist-history IMT of the rest (≈ 68 permutations); Refresh(Blacklist) inserts into it (≈ 264). F_payment +42 B, so R9 becomes 8,277 B (§3.5) |
| **B7.** `quota_share_expires_at_ms` is a core field; σ_send enforces `U < expires_at_ms` with the quota control | σ only; one 64-bit comparison |
| **B8.** `time_anchor_max_response_ms` < the shortest quota window, checked when a share is installed; σ_send checks `U − L ≤ time_anchor_max_response_ms` (a core field) with the quota control | Λ_refresh(QuotaShare): 64 length comparisons; σ_send: one comparison; two charge candidates per kind suffice |
| Gate degree ≤ 6; k ≤ 16; ≤ 1 GiB fold memory with one sub-proof at a time; std Rust only; identical outputs on every hardware; no new external crates | §§2, 6, 9 |

### 1.2 Binding constraints and how they are met

| Constraint | Met by | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1–2 s to durable completion; Ω verified on the path unless pre-verified | §4: ≈ 35–140 ms of phone proof CPU when pre-verified, +0.29–0.75 s cold | met [E]; hardware signing and durable commit unmeasured |
| R9: Ω + largest σ_send ≤ 10,000 − F_payment = 8,277 B (wire §4, F_payment = 1,723† with the B6 Request fields) | §3: Ω = 4,736 B; with the measured σ_send (3,296 B) the Ω budget is 4,981 B | met [C], margin 245 B |
| Credited::Status ≤ 10,000 B, Ω ≤ 7,812 B (wire §4, F_status = 2,188†) | 2,188 + 4,736 = 6,924 B | met [C] |
| Fold peak RAM ≤ 1 GiB | §6: one prover at a time, ≤ 0.85 GiB per sub-proof plus ≤ 0.15 GiB wallet core | met [E]; thresholds G3.6, G3.7, G4.6, G5.3 |
| First release; formats may be redesigned | PIPA-R profile and PIPA-AS-v1 (§8); σ moves to the base-field transcript at unchanged byte length | used |
| std, deterministic, no new external crates, Pasta curves | only `iroha_pasta`, `iroha_plonk`, `iroha_plonk_gadgets` and a new workspace crate `iroha_plonk_recursion`; verifier MSMs stay `msm_complete` (PIPA S10) | met |
| `credit_id`, `proof_digest` (σ only and Ω‖σ) and the Payment digest are `P` / `P_bytes` | spec-literal `P_bytes` over the bytes, linked in-circuit (§5.2) | met |
| Wallet maps (the blacklist history included) and the credit-digest tree are depth-32 IMTs; the quota-usage map is the B5 depth-6 array | IMT chip in A; the array shares the depth-6 path layer of the quota-window tree | met |
| Receiver matched by `wallet_id` and `payment_key`; continuity proven in Λ | A equalities; the Request's receiver credential is verified in Λ_recv and deduplicated with the current credential | met |
| One Fp head commitment; one `relation_id`; σ keys selected by (tag, mask), Receive by its Request's recorded blacklist version | `relation_id` is carried in D_A, never a circuit constant; σ's key is selected in Q by one-hot digest and checked in A against the (tag, mask) table, with the Receive selector derived from the Request | met |
| Enabled controls enforced in σ_send, the receiver's Request-recorded blacklist decision in σ_recv | Λ only selects σ's key; G-Ω2 bounds σ_send at 8,277 B minus the Ω length (3,541 B) | met; σ shape threshold |
| Proposal §3.2 containment: deferred failures burn or no-op, no poison | corrected-claim witness plus total soft verifiers (§2.7) | met |
| Proposal §3.2: native and in-circuit verifiers accept exactly the same set | one table-driven predicate (PIPA S11), complete in-circuit arithmetic, total soft verifiers (§7 C7) | met deterministically |

## 2. Architecture

### 2.1 Circuit kinds

Each Λ step is a fixed DAG of k16 circuits. Every consumed proof is verified completely in
the circuit whose field is its base field, except its 2^16 generator MSM, so no deferred
scalar crosses the cycle; the generator MSMs are accumulated by separate, local,
non-hiding PIPA-AS-v1 fold proofs (§3.4).

| Kind | Circuit field / proof curve | k | Advice / fixed / equality / lookups [E] | Holds |
|---|---|---:|---|---|
| σ (exists) | Fp / Vesta | 12 | 5 / 24 / 7 / 1 [M] | step relation; payment path |
| **Q** leaf | Fq / Pallas | 16 | 22 / ~32 / 8 / 3 | P-256 (variable key V, fixed key F) with its SHA block; the single **σ-leaf Q_σ** also holds every σ verifier of the step and the fold F_V^Q |
| **A** aggregator | Fp / Vesta | 16 | 32 / ~44 / 10 / 3 | all `P` work (openings, IMT, digests, `P_bytes`, consumer checks, lineage-adjusted values, burn logic); succinct verification of Ω(pred) (hard), Ω_in or Ω(h) (soft) and every Q (hard); fold F_P |
| **Ω** wrap | Fq / Pallas | 16 | 11 / ~18 / 4 / 1 | succinct verification of A (hard); fold F_V^Ω; selection of A's key; D_A passed through |
| **W** (context wrap) | Fq / Pallas | 16 | Ω's descriptor, other context domain | intermediate wrap of the A-split (§2.8); never transported |
| F_V^Q, F_P, F_V^Ω | PIPA-AS-v1 fold proofs | K = 16 | — | local, 1,088 B each [C] |

Field placement:

- `P` is native in Fp, so A holds all hashing.
- Pallas group operations are native in Fp, so A verifies the Pallas proofs (Ω, W, Q).
- Vesta group operations are native in Fq, so Q verifies σ and Ω verifies A.
- P-256 and SHA-256 are non-native in both fields; they sit in Fq leaves so that A, which is
  native for Pallas, verifies them cheaply.
- Each proof's transcript runs in its **base** field (PIPA-R, §8), so every verifier circuit
  runs the transcript natively. A foreign-field Poseidon would cost 20–35k cells per
  permutation [E] instead of 148 [M].

### 2.2 Per-step DAG and proving order

```text
  fold witnesses (proposal §4.1; payer data already natively verified at Receive)
        |
  Fq   Q_1 … Q_r (Pallas)    P-256 V/F + SHA slots (soft for incoming objects, hard for own)
        Q_σ (one of them)    σ verifiers (own hard; σ_send / σ_recv soft) + F_V^Q over the O_σ
        |        out: per signature (m, key, valid); per σ (d_σ, vk_index, valid, 107 byte chunks);
        |             acc_V^part; gated-slot modes
  Fp   A (Vesta)             verifies Ω(pred) [hard, witness key K], Ω_in or Ω(h) [soft, same K],
        |                    Q_1..Q_r [hard, keys fixed per A variant];
        |                    P: openings, IMT, receipt bodies, P_bytes, credit_id, consumer checks;
        |                    F_P over {acc_P(pred), O_Ω(pred), [acc_P(in), O_Ω(in)], O_Q1..O_Qr}
        |        out: D_A (binds the public fields, vkΩ_digest and acc_P); acc_V^part;
        |             acc_V(pred), acc_V(in) with its mode
  Fq   Ω (Pallas)            verifies A [hard, key K_A one-hot from T_A];
                             F_V^Ω over {acc_V^part, O_A, acc_V(pred), [acc_V(in)]}
                 out: [D_A, acc_V]; transported: π_Ω ‖ acc_P ‖ acc_V
```

Proving is native and sequential; each output is durable before the next proof starts:

1. Synthesize every value natively. Decide every incoming accumulator with the prover-side
   kernel (`msm_public`, 292–297 ms at 2^16 on 1 thread [M]) to choose the branch (§2.7).
2. Prove F_V^Q (when Q_σ holds two σ), then Q_σ, then the other Q leaves.
3. Prove F_P, then A.
4. Prove F_V^Ω, then Ω.
5. Self-verify Ω with the native verifier, both decides included, and record it (proposal
   §3.1 step 5).

### 2.3 Obligation ledger (PIPA S13)

| Obligation | Curve, k | Created by | Folded in | Mode |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| O_σ(own) | Vesta, 12 | σ verifier in Q_σ | F_V^Q; with one σ it is forwarded as acc_V^part (u padded 0^4 ‖ u) | hard |
| O_σsend (Receive), O_σrecv (ArchiveSent (i)) | Vesta, 12 | soft σ verifier in Q_σ | F_V^Q | gated |
| acc_V^part | Vesta, 16 | F_V^Q output, carried Q_σ → A → Ω as instances | F_V^Ω | hard |
| acc_V(pred) | Vesta, 16 | Ω(pred) instance, forwarded by A | F_V^Ω | hard |
| acc_V(in) / acc_V(h) | Vesta, 16 | Ω_in / Ω(h) instance, forwarded by A with mode and G* | F_V^Ω | gated |
| O_A | Vesta, 16 | A verifier in Ω | F_V^Ω | hard |
| O_Q (each leaf) | Pallas, 16 | Q verifier in A | F_P | hard |
| acc_P(pred), O_Ω(pred) | Pallas, 16 | Ω(pred) verifier in A (O from its suffix G'_0) | F_P | hard |
| acc_P(in), O_Ω(in) | Pallas, 16 | soft Ω_in / Ω(h) verifier in A | F_P | gated |
| acc_P (out) | Pallas, 16 | F_P output, bound in D_A | natively batch-decided with Ω's own opening; in Λ the next A's acc_P(pred) | — |
| Ω's own opening | Pallas, 16 | every native verifier; the next A | native batch decide; the next F_P | — |
| acc_V (out) | Vesta, 16 | F_V^Ω output, an Ω instance | natively decided; in Λ forwarded by the next A as acc_V(pred) | — |

Every obligation enters exactly one fold of its own curve, through a fixed slot of its
variant; *Trivial* and *Corrected* enter only through mode bits that the consuming circuit
constrains. By induction, Ω(h)'s own opening, acc_P and acc_V cover every obligation of the
lineage. Pallas and Vesta obligations cannot share an MSM (PIPA §11), so a consumer runs
exactly two 2^16 MSMs. A build-time test asserts the ledger for every variant
(`every_obligation_folded_exactly_once`).

### 2.4 Verifying keys without a cycle (PIPA S14)

Build order: σ VKs → Q VKs → A VKs → Ω VK → `vkΩ_digest` and
`lineage_verifying_key_digest` → `relation_id` and `verifying_key_set_digest` → `scheme_id`.

| Verifier → verified | Key binding | In-circuit cost [E] |
|---|---|---|
| Q → σ | Witness VK (31 points + `transcript_repr`); its `P_Fq` digest compared one-hot with the allowlist's σ digests (constants of Q). Q exports `vk_index`; A checks it against the constant (tag, mask) → index table, with a Receive mask of 1 iff its Request records a nonzero blacklist version (B6) | ≈ 32 permutations ≈ 4.7k cells |
| A → Q | Q variants' VKs are fixed columns of each A variant | 0 |
| A → Ω(pred), Ω_in, Ω(h), W | Witness key K. A computes `P(K)` and requires it to equal the `vkΩ_digest` field of the D_A(pred) it opens, copies that field into its own D_A, and recomputes D_A(in) with the same field. Bootstrap's A takes the field as a free witness | ≈ 23 permutations ≈ 3.4k |
| Ω → A | Witness VK_A (≈ 54 points + repr); `P_Fq` digest compared one-hot with T_A, the constant list of A-variant digests. No lookup argument, so Ω's bytes are unaffected | ≈ 56 permutations ≈ 8.3k |
| native verifiers → Ω | D_A recomputed with the artifact-set constant `vkΩ_digest` | 27 native permutations |

`relation_id` is a carried value in every circuit, σ included: σ takes it as witness limbs
bound by its statement digest (wire §3.2, `StatementV1`). It is never a circuit constant
(`relation_id_is_never_a_circuit_constant`).

### 2.5 Variants and the allowlist

- **One descriptor per kind.** Variants of a kind differ only in fixed columns (program,
  copies, constants).
- **σ shape classes.** A shape class is one σ descriptor (k, column counts, gate set).
  Relations of one class differ only in fixed commitments, share one Q_σ program and are
  selected by the one-hot key digest; each distinct class has its own Q_σ program. The
  allowlist (wire §3.1, at most 16 σ entries) holds every operation with mask 0, Send per
  supported mask and, when some Send mask enables the blacklist, Receive for a
  Request-recorded blacklist decision (selected by the Request's recorded version, not
  by the receiver's mask). With the B5 usage array the quota-enabled σ_send is expected
  to be a single-lane k14 class (k13 with shared window and usage paths), and the
  blacklist σ_recv to stay in the k12 class [E].
- **A variants.** One per (operation, σ shape classes it verifies): Bootstrap, Load, Send,
  Unload, Retiring, Receive and Receive (renewed receiver credential), ArchiveSent (i) and
  (ii), the five RefreshPolicy kinds and the A-split halves. T_A, the constant list in Ω, is
  sized at artifact freeze (≤ 32 expected [E]; each entry costs one comparison).

### 2.6 Base case

- Bootstrap's A has no Ω slot. It enforces the unique zero state (proposal §3.2) and writes
  free `vkΩ_digest` and `relation_id` fields, which every native verifier pins.
- F_P has one input, so acc_P = O_Q, passed through without a fold.
- F_V^Ω folds {acc_V^part = O_σ, O_A}.
- **Trivial accumulator** `ACC_TRIV(C) = (Σ_{i<2^16} g_i, 1^16)`: s_i = 1 for every i, so it
  decides by construction. It is pinned per curve by a KAT.

### 2.7 Soft verification, burn and no-op

**Soft verifiers are total.** They run for Ω_in or Ω(h) in A; for σ_send or σ_recv, τ_send,
τ_recv or τ(h) and the Request in Q; and for the consumer checks, `credit_id`
non-membership and the Request's recorded-blacklist history lookup (B6) in A. A lookup
always opens, hard, either the recorded version's leaf or its low leaf in the
predecessor's history root; its soft bit is false only on proven absence or an
authenticated root different from the recorded one, so a bad path is unsatisfiable,
never a burn. Each outputs a verdict bit and is satisfiable for every witness
(PIPA S12, §8): every decode check yields a bit and a failing input is replaced by a fixed
default before use; denominators are guarded by is-zero bits; group arithmetic is complete.

**Gated slots.** Every incoming obligation j (acc_P(in), O_Ω(in), acc_V(in), O_σin) enters its
fold in one of three modes: **Accept** (G_j, u_j); **Trivial** ACC_TRIV; **Corrected**
(G*_j, u_j) with G*_j ≠ G_j, checked natively in the fold-owning circuit (OQ-2).

```text
soft_ok  = AND of every soft bit (Ω_in succinct incl. D_A(in) recomputation, σ_send, τ_send,
           Request incl. its recorded-blacklist lookup, consumer checks, credit_id
           non-membership)
valid    = soft_ok AND (no slot in Corrected mode)
valid = 1  ⇒ every incoming slot is Accept
valid = 0  ⇒ every incoming slot is Trivial except at most one Corrected slot, and
             (soft_ok = 0) OR (exactly one Corrected slot)
```

A constrains every mode bit; Q and Ω receive them as instances.

**Λ_recv effects.** Λ checks the consumed-credit transition from the predecessor core to the
committed successor core (opened from σ_recv's successor head):

- On accept (valid = 1): the insert of `credit_id`, whose low-leaf part is the
  non-membership soft bit; the credit-digest tree inserts `credit_id → (Payment digest, 0)`.
- On burn (valid = 0): `burned_total += amount` (checked u128) and the `credit_id` stays
  consumed. The consumed-credit root (OQ-3) equals the predecessor's root or is a
  structurally valid IMT insert of a key proved absent from the predecessor's root. The
  credit-digest tree records `credit_id → (Payment digest, 1)` unless the key is already
  present.
- One credit-digest gadget serves both branches (membership-or-insert): its single opening is
  either the key's own leaf (present: root unchanged) or its low leaf (absent: insert).
  Existing-key membership preserves the existing Payment digest and burned flag, even when
  they differ from this Receive's proposed insertion: `burned` is fixed at the first
  insertion and the tree stays insert-only. A duplicate `credit_id` carrying another Payment
  digest therefore shows the original leaf to CreditStatus; that leaf does not match the
  second Payment, so native ArchiveSent rejects it and Λ_archive takes its no-op branch.

**Λ_archive** has the same structure with `valid_evidence`. On valid_evidence = 0 it takes the
no-op branch: Λ's pending-outgoing root keeps the descriptor and nothing else changes
(proposal §3.2).

Why this meets proposal §3.2 (§7 C8):

- **Deterministic.** Accept requires every incoming claim to fold, so the final decide forces
  them true. Burn requires a false soft bit (a deterministic function of the bytes) or a folded
  corrected claim, which forces G*_j = ⟨s(u_j), g⟩ ≠ G_j, so obligation j truly fails. The
  branch equals the native verdict; the prover cannot choose it.
- **No poison.** On burn, the only Payment-derived claim folded is a corrected claim, which
  decides for every u_j because the honest receiver computes G*_j itself. The lineage stays
  decidable and its other value is unaffected.
- **Kernel diversity.** The honest prover locates a failing claim with `msm_public`; the
  receiver's native check used `msm_complete`. Poisoning needs both kernels wrong on the same
  input.

### 2.8 A-split and runs

**A-split.** Used when a variant's A exceeds its capacity of 1.67M cells [E: 32 × 63k ×
0.83]:

1. A_1 verifies some Q leaves and writes `D_ctx = P(kgwctx_1, …)`, domain-separated from
   `kgwomg_1`.
2. W (Ω's descriptor, with its own VK, verifying the A_1 variant) wraps A_1.
3. A_2 verifies W as it verifies Ω(pred), then continues.

Native verifiers recompute only `kgwomg_1`, so W can never pose as Ω. Cost: +1 A, +1 W and
+2 folds ≈ +48–65 s on 1 Mac thread [E]. At the M3 P-256 thresholds the split is needed only by
Receive (renewed) at the high end of its band (§5.4); with the B5 usage array,
Refresh(QuotaShare) no longer needs it.

**Runs.** Send, Unload and Retiring commit only from a folded head (proposal §3.1), so a run
holds at most one Send-class step, and only first. An intermediate head of a run still needs
a W (A cannot verify A), and no pair of steps fits one A (§5.4). **The artifact set ships run
length 1.**

## 3. Ω encoding and size

### 3.1 Transport layout

Wire `lineage.proof`; the 320-byte public transcript (wire §3.2) precedes it and is counted in
F_payment.

| Offset | Bytes | Field | Rule |
|---:|---:|---|---|
| 0 | 3,648 | π_Ω: PIPA-R Pallas proof, k16, Direct typed instances, `FoldedGenerator` suffix, PIPA §7 order | exact descriptor length |
| 3,648 | 32 | acc_P.G (Pallas, compressed) | canonical, ≠ O |
| 3,680 | 512 | acc_P.u[0..16) (Fq, little-endian) | canonical, ≠ 0 |
| 4,192 | 32 | acc_V.G (Vesta, compressed) | canonical, ≠ O |
| 4,224 | 512 | acc_V.u[0..16) (Fp, little-endian) | canonical, ≠ 0 |
| **4,736** | | `lineage_proof_bytes` of the allowlist | §3.5 |

The 32-byte suffix keeps Ω's own opening point in the bytes, so the soft verdict of §2.7 is a
function of the bytes alone. Dropping it (4,704 B) is held in reserve.

### 3.2 Public instances and D_A

Ω's Direct instances are 19 Fq values: `[D_A (Bounded), acc_V.G.x, acc_V.G.y (Field),
acc_V.u_0..u_15 (Bounded)]`.

```text
D_A = P(kgwomg_1;
        version, scheme_id(lo,hi), relation_id(lo,hi), head, wallet_id(lo,hi), credential_digest,
        payment_key.x(lo,hi), payment_key.y(lo,hi), lifecycle + 2^8·policy_epoch + 2^72·enabled_controls,
        burned_total, pending_outgoing_root, credit_digest_root,
        vkΩ_digest,
        acc_P.G.x, acc_P.G.y, acc_P.u_0(lo,hi) … acc_P.u_15(lo,hi))
```

52 elements, **27 permutations** [C: ⌊52/2⌋ + 1]. `credential_digest` is one element because
the credential object digest is `P` (OQ-1). acc_P is bound only through D_A: Ω passes it
through, because it cannot do Pallas arithmetic. The native verifier recomputes D_A from the
public transcript, the transported acc_P and the constant `vkΩ_digest`.

### 3.3 Accumulator semantics

- **decide:** accept iff G = ⟨s(u), g[0..2^16)⟩ with s_i = Π_j u_j^{bit_{15−j}(i)} (PIPA §9.2).
- **Fold-input padding:** an obligation of k < 16 enters as (G, 0^{16−k} ‖ u); then s_i = 0
  for i ≥ 2^k, which is the k-round decide (prefix property, PIPA §3). Zero u_j occur only as
  fold inputs, never in transported accumulators.

### 3.4 PIPA-AS-v1 fold proof

BCMS20 PC_DL accumulation (snark-verifier `IpaAs`; reference `iroha_core_zk`
`accumulation.rs`):

- **Transcript.** A base-field sponge with tag `pipa-as1` absorbs a prover salt (one element),
  r, and for each slot (G_i as [x, y], k_i, u_i), then squeezes full-width α and z.
- **Prover.** h(X) = Σ α^i h_{u_i}(X), C = Σ α^i G_i, v = h(z); a **non-hiding** 16-round IPA
  opening of C at z (PIPA §9.2 without ξ·C_s and f·W): L_j, R_j, c and the suffix G'.
- **Verifier (succinct).** Recompute C with a complete Horner chain and v = Σ α^i Π_j (1 +
  u_{i,15−j} z^{2^j}); check C − v·g[0] + Σ(u'^{-1}_j L_j + u'_j R_j) − c·G' − c·b(z)·ζ·U = O;
  output (G', u').
- **Bytes and time.** 32·(2·16 + 2) = **1,088 B** [C], local only; 2.9–3.1 s on 1 Mac thread
  [E: generator fold 1.92–2.03 s [M] + L/R MSMs ≈ 0.7 s].

### 3.5 Byte budget and thresholds

With PIPA §7, d = 6, k = 16 and the suffix, π_Ω is 32·(44 + V) bytes, where
V = n_a + 8n_l + n_z + q_a + q_f + m + max(3n_z − 1, 0) + n_s. The Ω budget with the
measured σ_send is 8,277 − 3,296 = 4,981 B (B6 adds 42 B to F_payment), so
32·(44 + V) + 1,088 ≤ 4,981 requires **V ≤ 77**. The baseline Ω descriptor has V = 70 [E].

| Ω descriptor [E] | Transport [C] | Margin to 4,981 B |
|---|---:|---:|
| n_a 11, n_l 1, m 4, q_a 22, q_f 18, n_s 4 (baseline) | **4,736** | 245 |
| m 5 | 4,896 | 85 |
| n_a 12, q_a 24 | 4,832 | 149 |
| m 6, n_a 12, q_a 24 | 5,024 | −43 (fails) |
| + 1 lookup argument | 5,024 | −43 (fails) |
| Pow5 round constants share fixed columns with glue coefficients (q_f 13) | 4,576 | 405 |
| no suffix (reserve) | 4,704 | 277 |

- **G-Ω1:** the measured Ω descriptor has V ≤ 77 and exactly one lookup argument.
- **G-Ω2 (R9 joint):** |Ω| + max over allowlisted σ_send of |σ_send| ≤ 8,277 B, so with
  Ω = 4,736 B every σ_send is ≤ **3,541 B** [C]. k12 with one lane (3,296 B [M]) passes; k14
  with one lane (≈ 3,424 B [C]; the B5 quota-enabled shape, ≈ 346 permutations ≈ 12.8k lane
  rows [E]) and k15 with one lane (3,488 B [C]) pass; k16 with one lane (the measured pre-B5
  quota shape, 3,584 B [M]) and k14 with two lanes (3,840 B [C]) fail. If no single-lane shape
  fits an enabled control, proposal §8 requires a new owner decision (contingent question
  C-1, §12).
- **Credited::Status** = 2,188 + |Ω| = 6,924 B ≤ 10,000; the allowlist caps Ω at 7,812 B
  (wire §§3.1, 4), a derived envelope bound that B1–B8 leave unchanged.
- F_payment (1,723 B, computed from the B6 Request fields) and F_status are marked † in wire
  §4 until `size_tests.rs` re-measures them; the thresholds follow those constants.

### 3.6 Ω contents and rows

| Item [E] | Cells |
|---|---:|
| Verify A, full-width challenges (n_a 32), complete arithmetic included | 265–337k |
| Forwarded A instances (up to 66) | included |
| F_V^Ω verify, r = 3–4 | 70–91k |
| VK_A digest and one-hot | ≈ 8.3k |
| **Total** | **0.36–0.46M**, capacity 0.58M (11 × 63k × 0.83) |

Rows: ≈ 181–190 GLV terms × 130 rows over 10 columns (≈ 23–25k rows) plus ≈ 300
permutations × 37 rows (≈ 11k) ≈ 36k of 65,530 usable rows [E]. k15 (32,762 usable rows) does
not fit.

## 4. Receiver payment path

### 4.1 Setup, off the 2 s window

1. **Offer.** Verify the payer credential (issuer signature with a variable key, its certificate
   under the root) and the Offer signature: 3 P-256 verifications, 0.25–0.28 ms each [M].
2. **Lineage.** The payer always sends it right after the Offer (proposal §5.1 permits it):
   - check Ω's scheme, `wallet_id`, credential digest and `payment_key` against the Offer;
   - recompute D_A (27 permutations);
   - succinct verification of Ω: ≈ 154 base-field permutations and ≈ 450 scalar operations,
     2–6 ms on the Mac [E];
   - **two decides with `msm_complete`**: Pallas batches Ω's opening with acc_P (2^16 + ≈ 90
     bases); Vesta decides acc_V (2^16 + 1);
   - cache the verdict under `lineage_digest = P_bytes(kgwlin_1, Ω bytes)` (wire §3.2).
3. **Request.** Record the enforced blacklist version and root (or `(0, 0)`) and retain the
   payer's 580-byte gap opening (B6), sign the Request and precompute σ_recv against the
   recorded root: 0.27 s on 4 Mac threads, 0.77 s on 1 [M].

### 4.2 At Payment arrival (critical path)

| Step | Work | Mac | Phone [E] |
|---|---|---|---|
| Decode ≤ 10,000 B canonically | — | < 0.1 ms [E] | < 0.3 ms |
| Ω(pred) byte identity with the cached Lineage Ω | byte comparison (equal `lineage_digest`) | < 0.1 ms [E] | < 0.1 ms |
| Consumer checks, Request account digests; for a nonzero recorded blacklist pair, its history lookup and the retained gap opening against the recorded root (B6) | equalities, ≈ 35 + 68 permutations | < 0.5 ms [E] | < 1 ms |
| σ_send `verify_full`, key by (Send, Ω.enabled_controls) | k12; its 2^12 G'_0 MSM is 36.8 ms [M] | **39 ms 1t, 14 ms 4t** [M]; PIPA-R re-measure G4.8 | 15–32 ms (4 cores), 43–90 ms (1 core) |
| τ_send and Request P-256 | 2 verifications | 0.5–0.6 ms [M] | < 2 ms |
| `P` work: statement 14, receipt message ≈ 7, `operation_id` 3, `proof_digest` 136, `credit_id` 14, Payment digest and its object digests ≈ 14 | ≈ 188 permutations | ≈ 1–2 ms [E; native permutation timing unmeasured] | 2–5 ms |
| Consumed-credit IMT non-membership and insert in Advance | 265 permutations + store I/O | ≈ 1.5–3 ms + I/O [E] | 3–8 ms |
| σ_recv | precomputed; re-proved only if the head changed | 0 (0.27 s 4t [M]) | 0 (0.3–0.7 s) |
| τ_recv hardware signing, self-verify (0.25 ms), two durable commits | — | unmeasured | unmeasured |
| **Proof CPU, pre-verified** | | **≈ 49–58 ms on 1 thread** [E] | **≈ 35–140 ms** |
| Add if Ω was not pre-verified | §4.1 step 2 | 836–846 ms 1t [M, 2 × 418–423 ms]; 261–325 ms 4t [E] | **+0.29–0.75 s** (4 cores, optimistic); +0.48–1.50 s (pessimistic) |

Native verification is exactly PIPA-v1's predicate plus the PIPA-R transcript; parity with
the in-circuit verifiers comes from complete in-circuit arithmetic (§7 C7), not from any
native replay.

### 4.3 Against 1–2 s

The remainder of the 2 s budget is the payer's σ_send (0.27 s on 4 Mac threads [M],
≈ 0.3–0.7 s on a phone [E], provable speculatively after the Request is verified), a ≤ 10 KB
transfer, two hardware signatures and two durable commits (unmeasured). The cold path fits
2 s only if those stay under ≈ 0.5–0.9 s; pre-verification makes the receiver side
negligible.

### 4.4 Ledger and CreditStatus verifiers

Unload, fee claims and CreditStatus use the same native procedure: one Pallas and one Vesta
decide per Ω, 0.84 s on 1 Mac thread [M]. CreditStatus also recomputes Ω(h)'s
credit-digest root from the 32-sibling leaf opening (wire §3.4): 64 node permutations plus 4
for the value and the leaf.

## 5. Per-operation Λ budgets

### 5.1 Check placement

| Check | Placement |
|---|---|
| C1 predecessor | A: Ω(pred) hard with witness key K; Bootstrap uses the base variant |
| C2 own σ | Q_σ: hard σ verifier, key one-hot (Receive: by its Request's recorded blacklist version, B6). A recomputes the 26-element statement digest (14 permutations) and checks d_σ and `vk_index` |
| C3 own τ | Q: V slot under `payment_key` with 1 SHA block. A computes the signing message `m = P_bytes(kgwrcpt1, receipt body)`, `operation_id` (3), `proof_digest` = `P_bytes` over the linked bytes (55 σ-only or 136 Ω‖σ) and the receipt object digest `P(kgworcp1, [m, r_lo, r_hi, s_lo, s_hi])` (3) where a package digest needs it |
| C4 R10, spec-literal | Q: the current credential (V, issuer key from its certificate) and its certificate (F, scheme root), every step. A opens the credential body (25 + 8 permutations) and checks scope, relation, tag and provider contract |
| C5 continuity | A equalities. Λ_send checks the Request's payer account digest against the payer's own credential. Λ_recv verifies the Request's receiver credential, which binds `wallet_id`, `payment_key` and the receiver account digest; deduplicated with C4 when the digests are equal, otherwise verified (Receive (renewed): +V +F) |
| C6–C8 | A: core and rest openings, IMT operations, u128 arithmetic, lineage-adjusted values |
| C9 `relation_id` | carried in D_A |
| Incoming Payment | Ω_in soft in A; σ_send, τ_send and Request soft in Q; consumer checks and `credit_id` non-membership soft in A. No fee-schedule signature: proposal §3.2 gives fee terms to Λ_send against the payer's own policy, and the Request signature binds the fee and schedule digest |
| Receive recorded blacklist (B6) | for a nonzero recorded pair, a hard-authenticated lookup of its version in the predecessor rest's blacklist-history IMT (the leaf or its low leaf, ≈ 68 permutations), whose soft bit (present with the recorded root) joins the Request's verdict; σ_recv proves the gap in the recorded root. A recorded `(0, 0)` needs nothing |
| Credited evidence | (i) σ_recv (key by the Request's recorded blacklist version) and τ_recv soft in Q, with `proof_digest(σ_recv)` linked. (ii) Ω(h) soft in A, τ(h) soft in Q, IMT membership of `credit_id → (Payment digest, burned)` in Ω(h)'s credit-digest root (≈ 70 permutations) |
| ArchiveSent removal | two wire §3.2 removals (core root and Λ root; the Λ one skipped on the no-op branch); each relinks the predecessor and clears the slot: 4 depth-32 traversals (256 permutations), 3 leaf hashes (6) and the 7-element pending value bound to the retained Payment's descriptor (4), ≈ 266 permutations, so ≈ 2 × 266 for both, which §5.4 counts. Core and lineage removals are separate unless their roots and descriptors coincide |
| RefreshPolicy (Blacklist), B6 | insertion of `(list_version, entries_root)` into the rest's blacklist-history IMT (≈ 264 permutations) |
| RefreshPolicy (QuotaShare), OQ-4 with B5 | rebuild of the 64-slot usage array: the 64 predecessor usage leaves against the core's `quota_usage_root` (318 permutations), the 64 new window leaves against the share's signed `windows_root` (318) and the 64 successor usage leaves (318), ≈ 954 permutations, plus a constrained sorted merge of the two key-sorted arrays (≈ 128 key comparisons): matching keys keep `end` and carry `used`, an absent key starts at 0 only with `start ≥` the new floor (unless no share was held), a charged key is dropped only with `end ≤` the new floor, and every window is longer than `time_anchor_max_response_ms` (B8) |

Signed messages are `P_bytes` over the body transcript (wire §1): A links the transcript
bytes (2–3 cells per byte, 108–476 B per body) and hashes them; Q receives m as a Bounded
instance and feeds its 32-byte canonical encoding to SHA-256.

### 5.2 Signature, SHA and proof counts (spec-literal R10)

| Operation | P-256 V / F | SHA blocks | σ verified | Ω verified in A | Bytes linked in A |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Bootstrap | 2 / 1 (τ, credential; certificate) | 3 | 1 | 0 | σ (3.3 KB) |
| Load | 3 / 2 (+ voucher; LoadAuthorization certificate) | 5 | 1 | 1 | σ |
| Send, Unload, Retiring | 2 / 1 | 3 | 1 | 1 | Ω(pred) ‖ σ (8.4 KB) |
| Receive | 4 / 1 (τ_recv, credential, τ_send, Request; certificate) | 5 | 2 | 2 | σ_recv; Ω_in ‖ σ_send |
| Receive (renewed receiver credential) | 5 / 2 | 7 | 2 | 2 | as Receive |
| ArchiveSent (i) | 3 / 1 (+ τ_recv) | 4 | 2 | 1 | σ, σ_recv; opaque Payment `proof_digest` (283 chunks) |
| ArchiveSent (ii) | 3 / 1 (+ τ(h)) | 4 | 1 | 2 | σ; opaque Payment `proof_digest` |
| RefreshPolicy (every kind) | 3 / 2 | 5 | 1 | 1 | σ |

**σ byte crossing.** σ is verified in Q (Fq) but its `P_bytes` digest is computed in A (Fp).
Q decomposes σ into 31-byte chunks (2–3 cells per byte) and exports the 107 chunks as Bounded
instances (each < 2^248 < p); A pays their Lagrange evaluation, ≈ 0.43k cells each [E], about
46k cells per σ.

### 5.3 Shapes and unit costs

| Circuit | k | Advice | Local proof bytes [C] | Capacity (cells, 0.83 packing) [E] | Prove, Mac 1t [E] |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| σ | 12 | 5 | 3,296 [M] | — | 0.77–0.78 s [M] |
| Q | 16 | 22 | 6,016 | 1.15M | 21–30 s |
| A | 16 | 32 | 7,424 | 1.67M | 26–36 s |
| Ω / W | 16 | 11 | 3,648 (+1,088) | 0.58M | 15–21 s |
| PIPA-AS fold | K16 | — | 1,088 | — | 2.9–3.1 s |

Prove-time calibration [E]: a 25-column k16 circuit took 43.5 s with the vendored prover on 1
thread [M]; the measured native/vendored ratio of 0.43–0.60 gives 18.7–26 s. No native proof
wider than k14 has been timed (G3.6).

| Unit | Cells |
|---|---:|
| Pow5 permutation | 148 [M] |
| Tree node `P(d, [l, r])` | 2 permutations = 296 [M] |
| P-256 variable key (complete, low-S, SEC1, soft) | 0.2–0.4M [E]; **threshold 0.30M**; measured today with halo2-base: 1,466,624 [M, checklist §8] |
| P-256 fixed key (scheme root) | 0.06–0.15M [E]; **threshold 0.12M** |
| SHA-256 block, degree 6 | 37–50k [E] (Table8 source estimate 2,304 rows, unmeasured) |
| FF-CRT multiplication (Fq-in-Fp, Fp-in-Fq, P-256 p and n) | 80–100 [E] |
| GLV variable-base multiplication, full width | 1.2–1.5k + complete tail [E] |
| Complete-arithmetic surcharge per verified proof | 10–15k [E] |
| Verify σ / Q (24 instances) / A / Ω, complete arithmetic included | 149–191k / 236–297k / 265–337k / 167–212k [E] |
| Each further Direct instance of a verified proof | ≈ 0.43k [E] |
| PIPA-AS verify, r = 2 / 4 / 7 | 65–79k / 75–91k / 91–109k [E] |
| IMT insert or removal / non-membership / membership (depth 32; no map updates a value in place after B5) | 39.7k (265–267 permutations) / 10.0k / 9.9k [E] |
| Quota-usage array charge (depth 6, B5): window opening 15 + usage old and new 30 permutations | 6.7k [E] |
| Quota-usage array rebuild (three 64-leaf depth-6 trees, B5) | 141k (954 permutations) + merge [E] |
| Byte linking | 2–3 per byte; opaque 31-byte chunk ≈ 20 [E] |

### 5.4 Per-operation budget at the M3 P-256 thresholds (V 0.30M, F 0.12M) [E]

| Operation | Q leaves (cells) | A cells (cap 1.67M) | Ω cells | Folds | Proofs (Q + A + Ω) | Mac 1t | Phone 4 cores, optimistic / pessimistic |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Bootstrap | 1 (1.00–1.09M) | 0.31–0.40M | 0.34–0.43M | 1 | 3 | 67–94 s | 23–87 / 39–166 s |
| Load | 2 (1.01–1.05 + 0.48–0.56M) | 0.84–1.05M | 0.36–0.45M | 2 | 4 | 92–128 s | 32–118 / 53–227 s |
| **Send** | 1 (1.00–1.09M) | 0.67–0.81M | 0.36–0.45M | 2 | 3 | **70–97 s** | **24–89 / 41–172 s** |
| **Receive** | 2 (1.02–1.07 + 0.83–1.05M) | **1.18–1.45M** (B6 history lookup included) | 0.37–0.46M | 3 | 4 | **96–132 s** | **33–122 / 55–234 s** |
| Receive (renewed) | 3 | 1.43–1.76M; A-split at the high end | 0.37–0.46M | 3 (+2) | 5 (+2) | 118–163 s (+48–65 s split) | 40–150 / 68–289 s (+ split) |
| ArchiveSent (i) | 2 | 0.98–1.20M | 0.36–0.45M | 3 | 4 | 95–132 s | 33–121 / 55–233 s |
| ArchiveSent (ii) | 2 | 1.11–1.37M | 0.37–0.46M | 2 | 4 | 93–129 s | 32–119 / 54–228 s |
| Unload | 1 | 0.62–0.77M | 0.36–0.45M | 2 | 3 | 70–97 s | 24–89 / 41–172 s |
| Retiring | 1 | 0.58–0.73M | 0.36–0.45M | 2 | 3 | 70–97 s | 24–89 / 41–172 s |
| RefreshPolicy (Credential, worst other kind) | 2 | 0.81–1.02M | 0.36–0.45M | 2 | 4 | 92–128 s | 32–118 / 53–227 s |
| RefreshPolicy (Blacklist, B6 history insertion) | 2 | 0.85–1.06M | 0.36–0.45M | 2 | 4 | 92–128 s | 32–118 / 53–227 s |
| RefreshPolicy (QuotaShare, OQ-4 with the B5 array rebuild) | 2 | 0.97–1.18M; no A-split | 0.36–0.45M | 2 | 4 | 92–128 s | 32–118 / 53–227 s |

Time model [E]:

- Mac = n_Q·T_Q + T_A + T_Ω + folds·T_fold + proofs × (0.5–1.0 s, proving key from VK) +
  self-verify 0.86–0.90 s + 0.3 s per incoming-claim decide.
- Phone = Mac × 1.1–2.3 per core ÷ 2.5–3.2 for 4 cores (optimistic: 2.9× measured for σ k12,
  3.2× for narrow k14) or ÷ 1.3–1.9 (pessimistic: vendored wide-k16 scaling [M]).
- Time is set by the number of k16 proofs, not by cells.

### 5.5 Sensitivity

- **P-256 in its 0.2–0.4M estimate band.** Send-class steps take 1–2 Q leaves (70–128 s on 1
  Mac thread). At the high end Receive needs 3 Q leaves and A reaches 1.75M, so it takes the
  A-split: ≈ 229 s on 1 Mac thread, 210 s (optimistic) to 404 s (pessimistic) on 4 phone
  cores [E].
- **OQ-1 (B1, applied)** removes the SHA-256 work an `H`-digest wire record would add: about
  10–16 blocks per ordinary step, 41 on Receive and about 150 on ArchiveSent (ii) [E].
- **Available levers, none needed for a binding requirement:**

| Lever | Effect [E] |
|---|---|
| Inductive R10 (verify the credential only at Bootstrap and refresh) | Load, RefreshPolicy and ArchiveSent drop to 1 Q leaf (−22–31 s) |
| `proof_digest` over binding digests | −55–135k cells in A per step |
| Inline own σ instead of verifying it | −150–190k cells in Q |
| Precommitted own-key table | own τ 0.04–0.08M instead of 0.3M |
| 128-bit fold challenges | Ω −512 B |
| Audited fixed-base batch-affine decide (PIPA S10 amendment) | cold receiver ≈ −45% |
| 1-permutation tree nodes (hash-format change) | IMT costs −50% |

### 5.6 Scheduling, checkpoints, preemption

- **Checkpoints.** Sub-proofs run strictly in order and each output (≤ 7.4 KB) is persisted; a
  crash loses at most one sub-proof (15–36 s on 1 Mac thread).
- **Preemption.** Any payment interaction (Offer, Request, Payment) aborts the running
  sub-proof through a cooperative cancellation token checked at Rayon task boundaries, which
  frees its memory; the fold resumes from the last checkpoint. The payment path then has the
  device to itself (σ_recv proving peaks at 45–49 MiB, decides at 16.4 MiB [M]).
- **Order.** Folding runs in step order whenever the app runs or the phone charges. Receive
  needs no fold to complete; only the next Send, Unload or device move waits for the backlog.

## 6. RAM plan (≤ 1 GiB)

The peak falls in the quotient phase [E]:

- vectors = PK[2(F + m) + 6] + witness[c·n_a + 8n_l + 2n_z] + coset[n_a + F + m + n_z + 3n_l +
  4] + 2(d − 1);
- × 2 MiB at k16 × 1.15, + 8 MiB params + 64 MiB MSM scratch cap + 50 MiB core baseline.

The witness factor is c = 3 today, because `commit_advice` clones the witness values and then
keeps coefficients [S `crates/iroha_plonk/src/prover/advice.rs`]; c = 2 with an owned-witness
API. Streaming keeps fixed and permutation columns as coefficients only and drops advice values
once the permutation and lookup products are built.

| Circuit | Today (c = 3) | Owned witness (c = 2) | Streamed |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| A (32 / 44 / 10 / 3) | 0.91 GiB | **0.84 GiB** | 0.64 GiB |
| Q (22 / 32 / 8 / 3) | 0.72 GiB | 0.67 GiB | 0.53 GiB |
| Ω / W (11 / 18 / 4 / 1) | 0.44 GiB | 0.42 GiB | 0.34 GiB |
| PIPA-AS fold prover | ≈ 0.03 GiB | | |

Rules:

1. One prover at a time; Q leaves never run in parallel.
2. OnDemand coset policy [S `keys/pk.rs`]; Eager adds (d − 1)(F + m) vectors (≈ +0.6 GiB for A).
3. No cached proving keys: `keygen_pk_from_vk` rebuilds fixed and permutation values and
   coefficients from synthesis without commitment MSMs (0.5–1.0 s on 1 Mac thread [E]).
4. The owned-witness API (M4) is mandatory; streaming is the margin lever.
5. A process-wide MSM scratch budget of 64 MiB shared by concurrent kernels (the per-kernel
   `MemoryBudget` default is 256 MiB [S `crates/iroha_pasta/src/msm/budget.rs`] and advice
   commitments run in parallel).
6. No commitment tables while folding (+84 MiB per curve for a 4–6% gain [M]).
7. Envelope: measured prover peak ≤ 0.85 GiB plus ≤ 0.15 GiB for the rest of the wallet core.
   A circuit whose measured peak exceeds 0.85 GiB is split: A by the A-split, Q by moving a
   slot to another leaf.
8. Preemption frees memory (§5.6).

## 7. Soundness argument

Each claim rests on published constructions except where marked **novel**.

**C1. Single proofs (PIPA-v1 and PIPA-R).** PLONKish arithmetization with the GWC19
permutation, halo2 permuted lookups and the BGH19 IPA with succinct check and amortized
generator. Fiat–Shamir uses RP57 Poseidon as a random oracle; multi-round soundness follows from
state-restoration / round-by-round soundness. PIPA-R changes only absorption encodings, which
stay injective, and the challenge map: points as native [x, y]; a Vesta proof's Fp scalar as one
Fq element; a Pallas proof's Fq scalar as S6 limbs (lo < 2^128, hi < 2^127, lo + 2^128·hi <
q); challenges map Fq → Fp by w mod p and Fp → Fq by identity, at distance ≤ (q − p)/q =
2^−167.84 [C] from uniform. The Fiat–Shamir memo is required before freezing (G4.1).

**C2. Accumulation (PIPA-AS-v1).** BCMS20 PC_DL accumulation (ePrint 2020/499 §6) on BGH19 §3.
If (G', u') decides then, except with probability about (r + 2^16)/|F| per hash query, the
opened C = Commit(h) and every input decides: α is squeezed after every input is absorbed
(cancelling inputs is a degree-r event) and z after C (a degree-2^16 event). The format has no
hiding term, so "G is the commitment" is enforced by the decide itself.

**C3. PCD composition.** Each step is a constant-depth DAG (Q → A → Ω, or Q → A_1 → W → A_2 →
Ω), composed into PCD by BCMS20 PCD-from-accumulation and BCLMS21 (ePrint 2020/1618). The
theorems give constant depth; **unbounded lineage depth is heuristic**, as for Halo 2, Pickles
and Nova, and PIPA §11's TODO remains.

**C4. Full succinct verification in the base field.** Transcript and group operations of each
consumed proof are native in its verifier circuit. Scalar arithmetic is CRT foreign-field
arithmetic: the native residue plus 3-limb arithmetic modulo 2^258–2^264; an integer identity
holds when both residues agree and every limb and carry is range-bounded (halo2-ecc /
halo2wrong practice; 3 × 86-bit limbs fail the 512-bit product bound, 3 × 87 hold). **A written
carry-bound proof per modulus (P-256 p and n, Fq-in-Fp, Fp-in-Fq) is an M3 exit item (G3.4).**
Only accumulators and typed instances cross the cycle, each checked by equality.

**C5. Composition inside a step.** A's statement is the conjunction of its inner
verifications, equality of every Q instance with A's own values (`m`, keys, d_σ, `vk_index`, σ
byte chunks, accumulators, modes) and its own `P` relations. Hard slots force `valid = 1`.
Soundness follows by conjunction and C2.

**C6. Verifying-key continuity (§2.4).** Basis: the Pickles wrap-key treatment
(`dlog_plonk_index`). Induction on lineage depth: the native check pins the final D_A's
`vkΩ_digest` to the constant; A_h enforces `P(K_h)` equal to that field and to D_A(pred)'s
field, so K_h is genuine and Ω(h − 1) was verified under the genuine key; knowledge extraction
of Ω(h − 1) yields A_{h−1}'s witness, whose own equality continues the induction. It relies on
collision resistance of `P`. A payer Ω under a foreign key soft-fails, because D_A(in) is
recomputed with the receiver's field.

**C7. Complete in-circuit arithmetic and exact native parity.**

- *GLV iterations.* With acc initialized to [2]·T_top and joint signed digits {±1}, the
  accumulated scalar pair (a, b) has odd components with |a| ≥ 3 after the first iteration.
  The incomplete addition at iteration i is exceptional only if a nonzero vector of sup-norm ≤
  2^{i+2} + 1 lies in the GLV lattice {(x, y) : x + λy ≡ 0 mod r}. Its sup-norm minimum is
  **2^126.21 for both Pasta scalar fields** [C, Gauss reduction], so iterations i ≤ 124 are
  exception-free for every base P ≠ O and every scalar (Orchard's incomplete-addition argument
  lifted to GLV). Circuits use incomplete addition for i ≤ 122.
- *Remaining operations.* Iterations i ≥ 123, every Horner join and the IPA and fold sums use
  complete addition; bases that can be O are guarded by selection; [u_j^{-1}]L_j is a witness
  Q_j with [u_j]Q_j = L_j.
- *Consequence.* In-circuit group arithmetic is complete for every decodable input. With PIPA
  S11 (one table-driven predicate) and soft totality, the in-circuit verdict equals the native
  verdict exactly. Native verifiers stay `msm_complete` (S10).

**C8. Containment (§2.7). Novel selection rule.** Accept is sound by C2 on every gated slot.
Burn is sound because either a soft bit is false (by C7 the native verifier also rejects) or a
corrected claim is folded, so by C2 G* = ⟨s(u_j), g⟩ ≠ G_j and the native decide of that
obligation rejects. A corrected claim decides for every u (liveness). (accept ⇔ native accept)
∧ (burn ⇔ native reject), so the branch is unique. A burn moves value only out of the
receiver's spendable balance; it cannot create value. The OQ-3 root rule keeps the
consumed-credit IMT invariant (C10) on the burn branch, so no later non-membership becomes
false. The B6 history lookup keeps the branch unique: its opening is hard, and its soft bit
is a function of the authenticated leaf or low leaf, so the prover cannot select burn with a
bad path. A written memo is required (G4.1); it reduces to C2, C7 and C10.

**C9. Liveness of hard verification.** Q, A and Ω are hiding and are re-proved with fresh
blinds if self-verification fails, which by C7 never happens for honest witnesses. PIPA-AS takes
a prover salt as cheap insurance; grinding through it only adds hash queries, already counted in
C2.

**C10. Maps.** Every wallet map except the quota-usage array (below) and the credit-digest tree
is the wire §3.2 depth-32 indexed Merkle tree (the Aztec construction): leaves `(key, value, next_key)` sorted and linked from a
zero sentinel; membership opens the key's leaf; non-membership opens the low leaf with
full-field comparisons through S6 limbs; insert relinks the low leaf and writes into a slot
opened as empty in the intermediate root; removal relinks the predecessor and clears the slot.
The invariant (unique keys, one sorted list, every present key reachable) holds by induction,
because every insert proves absence through the low leaf and writes only an empty slot. Slot
positions carry no meaning, so the next free index stays a native rule that no root commits
(wire §3.2) without affecting soundness: allocation position and lifetime exhaustion are
native-store policy, not proved map semantics. A prover slot that differs from the native
store only breaks its own successor commitment, and CreditStatus relies on Ω's certified
root through membership alone. Slot `2^32 − 1` is a valid slot and only `f = 2^32` is
rejected (G1); any IMT reference kept for Λ follows that rule. Removal never reuses a slot:
unlinking without clearing would leave an orphan whose membership still opens. The
quota-usage map is not an IMT (B5): it is a depth-6 array whose slot `i` is bound to window
slot `i` by equal index, kind, start and end, so a Send's in-place charges at distinct slots
commute and leave every other slot unchanged. An empty slot (element 0) never opens as a leaf: that
would be a `P` preimage of 0. Leaf and node domains are separated (`kgwimlf1`, `kgwimnd1`);
binding is collision resistance of `P`.

**C11. Hash-then-sign.** ECDSA(SHA-256(enc(P_bytes(d, body)))) reduces to collision resistance
of `P` and of SHA-256 on 32-byte inputs, plus P-256 EUF-CMA (owner protocol choice). The
in-circuit P-256 is complete for natively accepted inputs: complete Renes–Costello–Batina
formulas, low-S, x(R) mod n.

**C12. Zero knowledge.** Ω follows the halo2 argument (PIPA §13). acc_P and acc_V are outputs of
non-hiding fold IPAs whose inputs derive from hiding proofs; in the ROM u is a hash of
high-entropy transcripts and G = ⟨s(u), g⟩ is public given u, so a simulator samples u. D_A is
a function of public fields and acc_P. Q, A and the fold proofs never leave the device. Ω
already exposes `wallet_id` and `payment_key`, so linkability is unchanged. The formal memo is
M4 work (PIPA §13 TODO).

## 8. PIPA-v1 extensions (applied to `plonk_ipa_v1.md` in M4)

- **PIPA-R profile.** A descriptor whose `transcript` is `KagemushaPoseidonRp57Base` is a PIPA-R
  proof: its transcript runs over the proof curve's base field B, it uses Direct instances with
  declared types and it carries the `FoldedGenerator` suffix. Every proof a KAGEMUSHA circuit
  verifies in-circuit (σ, Q, A, Ω, W) is PIPA-R. Message order, the §7 length formula and the
  §8–9 verifier equations are unchanged.
- **`CircuitDescriptorV2`** (`iroha.plonk.pipa.circuit_descriptor.v2`) = V1 plus the
  `KagemushaPoseidonRp57Base` transcript and `instance_types` (`Field`, `Bounded` (< p),
  `Bits(b)`, b ≤ 253) per instance column. PIPA-R requires `Direct` instances and the suffix;
  `descriptor_digest` and `transcript_repr` move to v2 domains, with `transcript_repr` a B
  element.
- **§6.2b base-field transcript.** `iroha_pasta::poseidon::Sponge` over B, first element
  `B::from(u64::from_le_bytes(*b"pipa-rb1"))`; points as canonical [x, y] (O rejected);
  scalars as one element when |F| < |B| and as S6 limbs when |F| > |B|; challenges c = w − p
  if w ≥ p else w (Vesta proofs) and c = w (Pallas proofs); `common_scalar(transcript_repr)`
  absorbed first. §6.3 absorbs one type code per instance column, and a value outside its type
  is rejected (`InstanceType`).
- **§9.3 in-circuit verifiers.** Horner chains with complete joins; variable-base `[c]P` by GLV
  (`c = k1 + λk2`, |k1|, |k2| < 2^128, one foreign-field multiplication), acc = [2]T_top,
  incomplete addition for i ≤ 122 and complete after; identity-guarded bases;
  `u_j^{-1}L_j` as witnessed Q_j with [u_j]Q_j = L_j; fixed bases (`g[0]`, `U`, `W`,
  `ACC_TRIV.G`) by 3-bit windows with a complete final window; soft mode as in §2.7. Foreign
  arithmetic is CRT with a written carry bound per modulus.
- **§11.1 `AccumulatorT`** = `G ‖ u_0..u_{K−1}` (32 + 32K bytes), canonical G ≠ O and nonzero
  canonical u_j. **§11.2 PIPA-AS-v1** as §3.4, with slot modes Accept, Trivial and Corrected
  (G* ≠ G, same u), and acceptance of a lineage proof = the decide of each exposed accumulator
  plus its own opening, batched per curve.
- **§12 invariants.** S6 and S11 extended to cross-cycle typed instances and the σ, Q, A, Ω, W
  and PIPA-AS verifiers; new **S12** complete in-circuit verification (§7 C7), **S13**
  obligation ledger (§2.3), **S14** key binding (§2.4). **§14** registers DEV-12 (base-field
  transcript) and DEV-13 (typed instances).
- **§15 open items, blocking the KAGEMUSHA artifact freeze:** the Fiat–Shamir memo for 6.2b and
  PIPA-AS-v1, the CRT carry-bound proofs, the GLV lattice KAT, the PCD statement and a Python
  reference verifier for 6.2b, PIPA-AS-v1 and `decide`.

## 9. Gadget list

Chips go in `iroha_plonk_gadgets` (M3); recursion components in the new workspace crate
`iroha_plonk_recursion` (M4). Every chip has degree ≤ 6, deterministic witness generation and
native/in-circuit equality tests against native references (`iroha_pasta`; test-only `p256`
0.13, `sha2` 0.10 and `num-bigint` 0.4, already in `Cargo.lock`). Vendored halo2 is only a test
oracle; the `iroha_core_zk` gadgets below are references, never dependencies.

Native side (`iroha_plonk`, M4): the PIPA-R transcript, typed instances,
`CircuitDescriptorV2`, the PIPA-AS prover and verifier, `create_proof` returning (G'_0, u),
`keygen_pk_from_vk`, the owned-witness and streaming prover API, the global MSM scratch budget,
a cooperative cancellation token and the `ACC_TRIV` constants.

## 11. Risks

|---|---|---|---|
| R1 | P-256 cost: estimated 0.2–0.4M cells, measured today at 1.47M | above 0.30M Receive needs the A-split (+48–65 s Mac); above 0.40M every operation gains a Q leaf | G3.1 first; window tables; precommitted own key |
| R2 | Ω byte margin of 245 B (B6 adds 42 B to F_payment) | one more lookup argument, or m 6 with 12 advice columns, overruns by 43 B | G4.3; q_f sharing (−160 B); dropping the suffix (−32 B); 128-bit fold challenges (C-2) |
| R3 | σ_send with enabled controls grows | above 3,541 B Payment breaks R9; the measured pre-B5 quota σ_send (3,584 B) already does | B5 usage array: single-lane k14 quota shape (≈ 3,424 B [C]), k13 with shared paths; G-Ω2 at artifact freeze |
| R4 | No native measurement wider than k14; quotient cost of the wide gate sets | fold times 1.5–2× the model | G3.6, G3.7, G4.7 |
| R5 | RAM: A at 0.84 GiB under the owned-witness API, close to 0.85 | over the cap | streaming (0.64 GiB); A-split; global scratch cap |
| R6 | Phone performance: per-core ratio 1.1–2.3, 4-core wide-circuit speedup unmeasured, thermals | Receive up to ≈ 4 min on a slow phone | G5.6; fold while charging or in the foreground; preemption |
| R7 | Merchant backlog: 30 receives an hour ≈ 17–61 min (optimistic) to 28–117 min (pessimistic) of 4-core folding per hour [E] | a busy merchant catches up only while charging | Receive needs no fold; only onward spending waits; no batching gain in this topology |
| R8 | Novel compositions: containment rule, PIPA-R Fiat–Shamir, CRT bounds, unbounded depth (heuristic) | late audit findings | the memos of G3.4 and G4.1 |
| R9 | Scope: about 12 gadget families, one interpreter, PIPA-AS, 3 circuit kinds with up to T_A variants | schedule | one interpreter driven by the S11 tables; variants as fixed programs |
| R10 | Durable commit and hardware signing latency unmeasured | the 2 s p95 target | G4/G5 device runs; pre-verification removes the decides from the path |

## 12. Text changes elsewhere and contingent questions

These changes keep the proposal, the wire record and PIPA-v1 consistent with §1.1. All but the
last were applied to the proposal and the wire record with the third set of owner answers
(2026-10-05, B1–B8); the implementation follows in G1 (wire §7, TODO(G1, third set)) and M4
(PIPA-v1):

- **Applied. Proposal §3 notation:** to decide an Ω is to run `decide` on each accumulator Ω
  carries (the Pallas accumulator bound in its public digest, batched with Ω's own opening,
  and the Vesta accumulator); these are Ω's deferred values. **§3.2:** Ω's public digest binds
  the lineage verifying-key digest, which every native verifier recomputes with the
  artifact-set constant.
- **Applied. Proposal §3.2 burn bullet (OQ-2, B2):** no accumulator or deferred value of the
  burned Payment enters Ω, except a corrected claim (G*, u) with G* = ⟨s(u), g⟩ ≠ G that
  Λ_recv computes itself to show that the Payment's accumulator (G, u) fails to decide; such
  a claim decides by construction. The same holds for Λ_archive.
- **Applied. Proposal §3.2 duplicate rule (OQ-3, B3):** on a duplicate, the committed
  consumed-credit root equals the predecessor's root or is a structurally valid indexed-tree
  insert of a fresh key. The credit-digest leaf of the first insertion stays (wire §3.2).
- **Applied. Proposal §3 hash families and wire §1 (OQ-1, B1):** the object digests of the
  request, receipt, credential, certificate, voucher, fee schedule and policy objects, the
  certificate-set and package digests, `operation_id`, the unload nullifier and the
  receipt's statement digest left the SHA-256 role table (34 → 18 roles) and are `P` values
  with the encodings of §1.1. The statement digest is the σ statement digest, now 26 elements
  (14 permutations), and `credit_id` has 26 elements (14) with the B6 fields. The wire §7 note
  that these "stay `H` although Λ recomputes them" is resolved.
- **Applied. Wire §3.3 RefreshPolicy (OQ-4, B4 with B5):** the end check is bounded to the 64
  quota-window slots and is part of the usage-array rebuild (§5.1).
- **Applied with B5–B8.** Wire §§3.2–3.4 and proposal §§3, 3.2, 5.1, 5.2 and 7: the fixed
  quota-usage array and its in-place charges, the Request-recorded receiver blacklist with
  its history and Request-derived Receive selector, the core quota share expiry and maximum
  anchor response time, and the Send time span.
- **Pending (G4.3). Wire §3.2:** `lineage.proof = π_Ω (3,648) ‖ acc_P (544) ‖ acc_V (544)`,
  4,736 bytes, once the Ω descriptor is measured.

Contingent owner questions, asked only if a threshold fails:

- **C-1.** A σ_send shape for an enabled control exceeds 8,277 − |Ω| (3,541 B at the baseline
  Ω), so Payment breaks R9 (proposal §8 requires a new owner decision). The measured pre-B5
  quota σ_send (3,584 B) does; the B5 shape is expected to fit (§3.5).
- **C-2.** The Ω descriptor exceeds V = 77 after q_f sharing and dropping the suffix: approve
  128-bit fold challenges (Ω −512 B, about 120-bit per-query Fiat–Shamir security for those
  challenges)?

# Runtime ABI — Canonical Hash (Torii)

Endpoint
- `GET /v1/runtime/abi/hash`

Response (first release; single policy V1)
```json
{
  "policy": "V1",
  "abi_hash_hex": "28209c6885b3bed442f0b2e4194d92e9e5b187f24c74c7837faa7a1f285c94d9"
}
```

Notes
- The hash is the canonical digest of the allowed syscall surface for the policy.
- Contracts may embed this value in manifests (abi_hash) to bind to the node's ABI.

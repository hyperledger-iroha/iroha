# Nexus Fees and Sponsor Programs

Nexus fees use a quote-to-sign protocol. A transaction always carries a typed,
signature-bound `FeePaymentIntent`; fee sponsorship is never inferred from
metadata and never falls back to charging the sender after a sponsor rejection.

Authenticated genesis bootstrap execution is additionally fee-exempt.
When Core applies the genesis block against an empty committed block history,
it bypasses fee-intent admission and fee settlement so bootstrap state does not
depend on balances, sponsor revisions, or receipt leases that genesis has not
created yet. Public fee quotes and every non-genesis transaction retain the
strict quote-to-sign, admission, and settlement rules described below.

The `nexus` charge component uses canonical XOR (`xor#universal`, or its
canonical asset definition literal). A `pipeline_gas` component may instead
use one exact asset accepted by the governed gas schedule. A signed intent
identifies either the transaction authority or one exact on-chain sponsor
program and immutable revision. It also contains a positive gas bound when the
executable needs gas and a canonically ordered maximum for each applicable
charge component. The legacy metadata keys `fee_sponsor`, `gas_limit`, and
`gas_asset_id` are rejected before signing and at admission.

## Quote, sign, submit

Clients should use the following flow:

1. Build one exact unsigned `TransactionPayload`. Fix the chain, authority,
   executable, timestamps, nonce, metadata, payer, exact sponsor-program
   revision, and gas bound. Charge maxima may initially be empty.
2. Account-sign `POST /v1/fees/quote` with JSON `{"payload": <payload>}`. The
   request signer must be the payload authority.
3. Inspect the returned ledger observation, canonical route dataspace, charge
   components, sponsor capacities, debit source, and recommended intent.
4. Verify that the quote retained the selected payer, exact program revision,
   and gas bound. Replace only `payload.fee_payment` with the returned intent.
5. Sign and submit that exact payload.

The quote endpoint normally authenticates against the authority's committed
account record. One narrow bootstrap exception permits a canonical single-key
authority that is not yet committed when the payload's first instruction
registers that exact authority. Torii verifies the request with the controller
embedded in the canonical `AccountId`; aliases, multisig witnesses, other
endpoints, and payloads registering another account do not receive this
exception. If the account already exists, its committed controller remains
authoritative.

Torii derives routing through the same queue router used by admission. The
client cannot provide an authoritative route override. Because fees depend on
ledger state, a quote is an observation rather than a reservation; queue
admission repeats the checks and creates deterministic maximum-bound
reservations to prevent concurrent oversubscription.

Rejections include a stable fee code, whether retrying can help, the observed
height, the exact program/revision when applicable, and remediation guidance.
Important codes include `invalid_fee_intent`, `program_not_found`,
`revision_not_active`, `program_not_active`, `beneficiary_not_eligible`,
`operation_not_allowed`, `operation_denied`, `invalid_gas_limit`,
`signed_limit_exceeded`, the three deterministic budget-exhaustion codes,
`vault_insufficient`, `authority_payer_insufficient`,
`relay_capacity_unavailable`, and `invalid_program_configuration`.

## Sponsor programs

A `FeeSponsorProgramId` is the canonical `sponsor-account/program-name`
literal. Program state and funding are consensus-visible:

- `staged`: being provisioned; it cannot sponsor transactions.
- `active`: the active immutable revision may sponsor eligible operations.
- `paused`: deliberately stopped; new sponsorship is rejected.
- `closing`: new sponsorship is rejected while obligations drain.
- `closed`: permanent tombstone; the identifier cannot be reused.

Revisions are immutable and monotonically numbered. The requested activation
height is an earliest bound: consensus postpones the switch until every
unexpired allocation from an older revision has ended. Once activation is
scheduled, old-revision leases must expire before the effective activation
height, so the worker can continue serving the old revision without stranding
locked vault capacity. A revision contains:

- an eligibility mode (`enrolled_only` or `enrolled_or_route_default`);
- ordered allow/deny rules over exact signed operations;
- per-asset transaction, block, program-epoch, and beneficiary-epoch limits;
- a reserve floor and deterministic epoch length.

Rules do not contain wildcards disguised as empty selectors. Native
instructions select an exact registered wire ID and, for asset transfers, may
select an exact asset definition. Contract calls select an exact contract
address, deployed code hash, and entrypoint set. Raw and proved IVM operations
select an exact code hash. A matching deny rule overrides an allow rule.

Eligibility is represented by explicit on-chain enrollment records. A
dataspace may name one exact default program with
`fee_sponsor_program_id`; this grants route-default eligibility only when the
active revision permits it. It does not change the program/revision named in a
signed transaction.

Each program has isolated per-asset vault allocations backed by the configured
`nexus.fees.sponsor_vault_custody_account_id`. Funding moves assets into
custody and credits only the exact program vault. The program record contains
one mandatory, immutable `payout_account`; creation rejects an account that is
not registered, and that account cannot be unregistered while the program is
not closed. `WithdrawFeeSponsorProgram` carries only the program, asset, and
amount: it has no caller-selected destination. Only the exact sponsor account
may authorize a withdrawal, never a program manager, role, or delegated
withdrawal token, and Core releases value only to the recorded payout account
in a paused or closing lifecycle state. One program cannot consume another
program's balance.

Sponsor-program vault assets must use the `Global` balance policy in the first
release. Revision staging, vault funding, receipt-lease registration, and a
later `Global` to `DataspaceRestricted` policy migration all fail closed when
they would create an unscoped sponsor balance. Supporting
`DataspaceRestricted` sponsor assets requires a future scope-keyed vault,
reservation, and spend-lease ledger. This restriction does not prevent an
authority from paying a dataspace-restricted PipelineGas asset in direct mode;
that debit is reserved and settled against the transaction's exact route
bucket.

Governed `ivm_gas_units_per_gas` updates are validated atomically before they
enter consensus state. Asset identifiers must be canonical and unique, TWAPs
must be positive decimals, and liquidity/volatility labels must be known. A
zero `units_per_gas` remains valid when Nexus already settles gas through its
own component. Execution also decodes any persisted governed snapshot
fallibly, so malformed state produces a configuration rejection rather than a
node panic.

Receipt-lane spend leases are source locks. Only the program sponsor or a
delegate holding `CanManageFeeSponsorProgram` may register one. Registration
rejects future source heights, recomputes the proof's source-state commitment
from the authoritative exact program vault, permits at most one unexpired
lease per `(program, revision, asset, dataspace)` route, and rejects any live
aggregate whose unspent remainder would exceed that vault. The relay worker
partitions one vault deterministically across every eligible manifest-backed
dataspace; it never copies the full balance into multiple routes and renews a
route only as its prior lease expires. Renewal is driven by the AXT replay
retention horizon; there is no independent budget-refresh interval. Explicitly
enrolled programs receive leases even when they are not a route default.
Withdrawals must leave every unexpired lease remainder intact, and final close
waits until executed receipt usage has been merge-settled.

Verified allocation, executed-usage, and merge-settled-usage records are
native-authored consensus state. Contracts may read and enumerate their
canonical keys, but generic IVM state syscalls cannot create, overwrite, or
delete them; updates must pass through the validating native allocation and fee
settlement paths.

## Reservations and settlement

Queue admission reserves the deterministic quoted maxima authorized by the
signed intent. In direct mode this includes ordinary authority balances;
sponsor payments reserve exact program vault and budget capacity in both modes.
In `lane_relay_burn` mode, admission also reserves the selected route lease for
the aggregate maximum charged in each asset, including PipelineGas.
Reservations are released on every queue exit: routing or push failure,
rejection, expiry/culling, proposal removal, queue clearing, and commit.
Rechecks subtract existing reservations before admitting another transaction.

Execution is ordered as reserve, execute the business payload, then settle:

- Admission, routing, configuration, and internal execution failures do not
  charge a fee.
- A business-level rejection after valid admission settles the deterministic
  actual work performed, bounded by the signed maxima.
- Successful execution settles the deterministic actual charge, never the
  reserved maximum, and releases the remainder.

There is no sender fallback. If a selected sponsor program is missing,
inactive, ineligible, disallows an operation, lacks budget, or lacks vault
capacity, the transaction is rejected with that sponsor error.

## Direct and receipt-backed lanes

`nexus.fees.settlement_mode` supports only `direct` and
`lane_relay_burn`.

In direct mode, settlement debits the authority balance or the exact isolated
sponsor-program vault in the canonical fee context and records the component
receipts needed to recompute the charge.

In lane-relay-burn mode, a DPN lane records versioned fee receipts without
mutating public XOR locally. Nexus applies the debit only when the corresponding
relay settlement commits. This mode is sponsor-only: quotes, queue admission,
and execution reject authority-paid Nexus fees with
`relay_capacity_unavailable` and direct clients to select an active program's
exact active revision. A public authority balance is not a safe substitute for
an authenticated source lock, and there is no authority exception for a
transaction that creates or redeems funds during execution. Authority payment
remains available in direct mode; receipt settlement can add it only after an
authenticated authority-lease protocol exists. Sponsor-backed relay settlement
requires a verified, receipt-bound allocation for the exact program revision
and fee asset. Relay, settlement hash, coordinates, charge calculation,
source-ID uniqueness, and capacity are checked before mutation. Invalid or
replayed evidence fails atomically and cannot partially debit a payer.
Every sponsored vault debit in this mode consumes its exact route lease.
PipelineGas remains directly settled to the technical account, so its lease
usage is recorded as executed and settled atomically; Nexus receipt usage is
recorded as executed first and becomes settled only when relay merge commits.

Block status exposes fee receipts and lane settlement commitments for audit and
reconciliation. Receipt amounts are canonical decimal strings, and fixed byte
arrays are exact-width uppercase hexadecimal in Norito JSON.

## Operator checklist

- Configure the canonical XOR Nexus fee asset, accepted PipelineGas assets, and
  dedicated sponsor-vault custody account.
- Keep every sponsor-program budget and vault asset globally scoped.
- Create a program, stage an immutable revision, fund every budgeted asset,
  enroll beneficiaries, and schedule activation.
- Configure route defaults by exact program ID only where desired.
- Grant each configured relay-worker authority `CanManageFeeSponsorProgram`
  for the sponsor whose allocation proofs it submits.
- Use `/v1/fees/quote` in clients and automation; do not manufacture maxima or
  encode fee controls in transaction metadata.
- Monitor stable rejection codes, queue reservations, vault capacity, budget
  windows, and settlement receipts.
- For receipt-backed lanes, verify the first post-activation protocol settlement
  before retiring any temporary external reconciler.

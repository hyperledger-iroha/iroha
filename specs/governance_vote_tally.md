# Development vote-membership fixture (not election qualification)

The depth-8 `VoteBoolCommitMerkle<8>` relation in `crates/iroha_core/src/zk.rs`
remains a development fixture. It proves one fixed boolean commitment and eight
fixed left-branch compression steps. It does not prove credential ownership,
election/choice binding, ciphertext correctness, aggregate conservation, a
sound tally, or successful completion despite dropout.

The closed production Halo2 registry rejects
`halo2/pasta/ipa/vote-bool-commit-merkle8`. Neither a raw valid IPA proof, a
registry-shaped record, nor a synthetic host verification latch admits that
relation as a ballot or tally. No deployment key or election should be created
from these artifacts. Ballot and tally construction/qualification remain open
in `specs/zk_audit_matrix.md` and `specs/privacy_first_release_closure.md`.

## Exact fixture relation

Over Pasta Fp, `C(a,b) = 2(a+7)^5 + 3(b+13)^5`. The witness uses vote `1`,
rho `12345`, commitment `C(1,12345)`, and siblings `20..27`. Each root step is
`C(previous, sibling)`. The public instance consists of two columns with one row
each: commitment, then root. The test helper verifies the actual raw IPA proof;
commitment, root, transcript mutation and transcript truncation are negative
controls. These checks do not establish a production election relation.

## Single developer fixture owner

`xtask/src/vote_tally.rs` owns deterministic development artifact generation.
The obsolete duplicate Core example and production-sounding public command
have been removed; there is no compatibility alias.

```sh
cargo run -p xtask --bin xtask --features dev-tools,dev-vote-fixture -- zk-dev-vote-fixture \
  --out target/dev-vote-membership --print-hashes \
  --summary-json target/dev-vote-membership/summary.json \
  --attestation target/dev-vote-membership/artifacts.json
cargo run -p xtask --bin xtask --features dev-tools,dev-vote-fixture -- zk-dev-vote-fixture \
  --out target/dev-vote-membership --verify \
  --attestation target/dev-vote-membership/artifacts.json
```

The generator raw-verifies before writing and separately requires rejection by
production dispatch. Metadata says `production_admissible: false`. The public
input digest identifies concrete fixture values; it is not a production schema
commitment. The key digest uses Core's canonical `hash_vk`. The deterministic
`fixture_id` is an identifier, not a timestamp. The artifact manifest checks
exact bytes/digests and contains no security-review signature or promotion claim.

## Controls and limits

- `zk_vote_tally_audit.rs`: raw proof/instance/transcript controls; production
  dispatch, key registration, and `VerifyProof` rejection, including corrupted
  retained registry state and altered public-input/schema fields.
- `gov_zk_ballot.rs`: pre-proof input admission and invalid retained-key rejection.
  Former toy-proof acceptance/deduplication claims are replaced by no-mutation
  controls, including repeated submissions and hint variants. Real ballot
  acceptance, credential-linked nullifier derivation and deduplication remain open.
- `zk_verify_vendor_e2e.rs`: missing-latch rejection and rejection of the retired
  relation even when a test-only latch is forced. This is not a successful ballot.
- `gov_zk_ballot_real_vk.rs`, `gov_zk_ballot_lock_verified.rs`, and
  `gov_finalize_real_vk.rs`: existing closed-registry/retained-state adversaries.

Native tests and regenerated artifacts must be run against the reviewed candidate;
source inspection and independent arithmetic alone are not proof qualification.

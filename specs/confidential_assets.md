# Confidential Assets & Protocol-Bound ZK Design

## Motivation
- Deliver opt-in shielded asset flows so domains can preserve transactional privacy without altering transparent circulation.
- Provide auditors and operators with lifecycle controls (activation, rotation, revocation) for circuits and cryptographic parameters.

## Threat Model
- Validators are honest-but-curious: they execute consensus faithfully but attempt to inspect ledger/state.
- Network observers see block data and gossiped transactions; no assumption of private gossip channels.
- Out of scope: off-ledger traffic analysis, quantum adversaries (tracked separately under PQ roadmap), ledger availability attacks.

## Design Overview
- Assets may declare a *shielded pool* in addition to existing transparent balances; shielded circulation is represented via cryptographic commitments.
- Notes encapsulate `(asset_id, amount, recipient_view_key, blinding, rho)` with:
  - Commitment: `Comm = Pedersen(params_id || asset_id || amount || recipient_view_key || blinding)`.
  - Nullifier: `Null = Poseidon(domain_sep || nk || rho || asset_id || network_id)`, where `network_id` is the exact genesis-derived `NetworkId`, independent of note ordering.
  - Encrypted payload: `enc_payload = AEAD_XChaCha20Poly1305(ephemeral_shared_key, note_plaintext)`.
- Specialized confidential protocols transport Norito-encoded proof payloads containing:
  - Public inputs: Merkle anchor, nullifiers, new commitments, asset id, circuit version.
  - Encrypted payloads for recipients and optional auditors.
  - Zero-knowledge proof attesting value conservation, ownership, and authorization.
- Verifying keys and parameter sets are controlled through on-ledger registries with activation windows; nodes refuse to validate proofs that reference unknown or revoked entries.
- Consensus headers commit to the active confidential feature digest so blocks are only accepted when registry and parameter state matches.
- Proof construction uses a Halo2 (Plonkish) stack without trusted setup; Groth16 or other SNARK variants are intentionally unsupported in v1.

### Deterministic Fixtures

Confidential memo envelopes now ship with a canonical fixture at `fixtures/confidential/encrypted_payload_v1.json`. The dataset captures a positive v1 envelope plus negative malformed samples so SDKs can assert parsing parity. The Rust data-model tests (`crates/iroha_data_model/tests/confidential_encrypted_payload_vectors.rs`) and Swift suite (`IrohaSwift/Tests/IrohaSwiftTests/ConfidentialEncryptedPayloadTests.swift`) both load the fixture directly, guaranteeing that Norito encoding, error surfaces, and regression coverage stay aligned as the codec evolves.

The generic proofless `zk::Shield` instruction is not part of the first-release
wire surface. Wallets move public value into the confidential tree only with
`TopUpKagemushaRecursiveV4`, whose payer/device authorization, exact amount,
note commitment, initial/final roots, leaf index, active verifier, and proof are
validated together before escrow reservation or tree mutation. The encrypted
memo-envelope fixture remains a local wallet codec fixture and is not an
authorization to append a commitment.

## Consensus Commitments & Capability Gating
- Block headers expose `conf_features = { vk_set_hash, poseidon_params_id, pedersen_params_id, conf_rules_version }`; the digest participates in the consensus hash and must equal the local registry view for block acceptance.
- Governance can stage upgrades by programming `next_conf_features` with a future `activation_height`; until that height, block producers must continue to emit the previous digest.
- Validator nodes MUST operate with `confidential.enabled = true` and `assume_valid = false`. Startup checks refuse to join the validator set if either condition fails or if local `conf_features` diverge.
- P2P handshake metadata now includes `{ enabled, assume_valid, conf_features }`. Peers advertising unsupported features are rejected with `HandshakeConfidentialMismatch` and never enter consensus rotation.
- Non-validator observers may set `assume_valid = true`; they blindly apply confidential deltas but do not influence consensus safety.

## Asset Policies
- Each registered asset definition carries runtime `AssetConfidentialPolicy` state. Public asset registration always creates `TransparentOnly`; only verifier-backed `RegisterZkAsset` execution and validated policy-transition instructions may change it:
  - `TransparentOnly`: default mode; only transparent instructions (`MintAsset`, `TransferAsset`, etc.) are permitted and shielded operations are rejected.
  - `ShieldedOnly`: confidential movement remains available, but the
    proof-bound Kagemusha public redemption path is forbidden so balances do
    not surface publicly.
  - `Convertible`: holders may move value between transparent and shielded representations using the on/off-ramp instructions below.
- Policies follow a constrained FSM to prevent stranding funds:
  - `TransparentOnly → Convertible` occurs only when `RegisterZkAsset`
    installs at least one canonical Kagemusha verifier binding.
  - `Convertible → ShieldedOnly` (enforced minimum delay).
  - `ShieldedOnly → Convertible` re-enables proof-bound public redemption.
  - `Convertible` or `ShieldedOnly` can never return to `TransparentOnly` in
    ABI V1, even when the commitment log is empty. Registration, scheduled
    activation, read-only effective-mode projection, and due-transition
    application all preserve this invariant.
- The asset-definition owner, or an account with the exact scoped
  `CanManageAssetDefinitionConfidentialPolicy` grant, may register verifier
  bindings or schedule/cancel policy transitions. The generic
  `CanModifyAssetDefinitionMetadata` grant does not authorize these operations.
  Core enforces this before any policy state is applied, independently of the
  executor admission layer.
- Governance instructions set `pending_transition { new_mode, effective_height, previous_mode, transition_id, conversion_window }` via the `ScheduleConfidentialPolicyTransition` ISI and may abort scheduled changes with `CancelConfidentialPolicyTransition`. Scheduling is valid only between `Convertible` and `ShieldedOnly`; a `TransparentOnly` asset must activate through verifier registration. Mempool validation ensures no transaction straddles the transition height and inclusion fails deterministically if a policy check would change mid-block.
- Pending transitions are applied automatically when a new block opens. A derived, snapshot-rebuilt index stores one exact `(effective_height, asset_definition_id)` key per transition plus an exact count per height, so scheduling and cancellation remain logarithmic and block opening is proportional to transitions that are due rather than to the total number of asset definitions. Scheduling, cancellation, application, asset replacement, and unregistration update both derived stores atomically with authoritative policy state. Snapshot and startup reconstruction reject a malformed pending transition immediately, even when its advertised height is far in the future. At the programmed `effective_height`, the runtime updates `AssetConfidentialPolicy`, refreshes `zk.policy` metadata, and clears the pending entry. If transparent supply remains when a `ShieldedOnly` transition matures, the runtime clears the transition, logs a warning, and retains the currently active mode. It never restores an earlier transparent mode after a conversion window has opened.
- Config knobs `policy_transition_delay_blocks` and `policy_transition_window_blocks` enforce minimum notice and grace periods to let wallets convert notes around the switch. `policy_transition_max_per_height` limits deterministic start-of-block work and rejects a schedule before any policy mutation when the target height is full.
- `pending_transition.transition_id` doubles as an audit handle; governance must quote it when finalising or cancelling transitions so operators can correlate on/off-ramp reports.
- `policy_transition_window_blocks` defaults to 200 blocks, and `policy_transition_max_per_height` defaults to 256. Nodes reject governance requests that attempt shorter notice or exceed the exact-height capacity.
- Genesis manifests and CLI flows surface current and pending policies. Admission logic reads the policy at execution time to confirm each confidential instruction is authorised.
- The optional `vk_shield` binding enables first-release Kagemusha top-up only
  and must resolve to the canonical top-up circuit and public-input schema.
  It may be configured only when `vk_unshield` is also configured, so every
  note that can enter has a proof-bound redemption path. After the first
  commitment is appended, registration cannot clear or change the unshield
  verifier commitment. Governance may rotate its identifier only to an active
  canonical registry record with the same commitment. Asset registration has
  no transfer-verifier role; Kagemusha selects its global transfer-v2 verifier
  independently. No generic commitment-ingress, confidential-transfer, or
  public-withdrawal instruction exists.
- Migration checklist — see “Migration sequencing” below for the staged upgrade plan that Milestone M0 tracks.

#### Monitoring transitions via Torii

Wallets and auditors poll `GET /v1/confidential/assets/{definition_id}/transitions` to inspect
the active `AssetConfidentialPolicy`. The JSON payload always includes the canonical
asset id, the latest observed block height, the policy’s `current_mode`, the mode that is
effective at that height (conversion windows temporarily report `Convertible`), and the
expected `vk_set_hash`/Poseidon/Pedersen parameter identifiers. Swift SDK consumers can call
`ToriiClient.getConfidentialAssetPolicy` to receive the same data as typed DTOs without
hand-written decoding. When a governance transition is pending the response also embeds:

- `transition_id` — audit handle returned by `ScheduleConfidentialPolicyTransition`.
- `previous_mode`/`new_mode`.
- `effective_height`.
- `conversion_window` and the derived `window_open_height` (the block where wallets must
  begin conversion for ShieldedOnly cut-overs).

Example response:

```json
{
  "asset_id": "62Fk4FPcMuLvW5QjDGNF2a4jAmjM",
  "block_height": 4217,
  "current_mode": "Convertible",
  "effective_mode": "Convertible",
  "vk_set_hash": "8D7A4B0A95AB1C33F04944F5D332F9A829CEB10FB0D0797E2D25AEFBAAF1155D",
  "poseidon_params_id": 7,
  "pedersen_params_id": 11,
  "pending_transition": {
    "transition_id": "BF2C6F9A4E9DF389B6F7E5E6B5487B39AE00D2A4B7C0FBF2C9FEF6D0A961C8ED",
    "previous_mode": "Convertible",
    "new_mode": "ShieldedOnly",
    "effective_height": 5000,
    "conversion_window": 720,
    "window_open_height": 4280
  }
}
```

A `404` response indicates no matching asset definition exists. When no transition is
scheduled the `pending_transition` field is `null`.

### Policy state machine

| Current mode | Next mode | Prerequisites | Effective-height handling | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `TransparentOnly` | `Convertible` | Call `RegisterZkAsset` with at least one active canonical `vk_shield` or `vk_unshield` binding. | Activation is immediate; this is not a scheduled transition. | Confidential activation is irreversible in ABI V1. |
| `Convertible` | `ShieldedOnly` | Schedule with the required lead time and conversion window. Transparent supply must be zero at cut-over. | On success the policy becomes `ShieldedOnly`. If transparent supply remains, the pending transition is cleared and the current `Convertible` mode is retained. | Disables public redemption without invalidating confidential notes. |
| `ShieldedOnly` | `Convertible` | Schedule with the required lead time. | State flips at `effective_height`; proof-bound Kagemusha redemption becomes available again. | Existing notes and verifier bindings remain valid. |
| Either confidential mode | Same as current | Cancel the exact pending `transition_id`. | The pending entry is removed immediately. | Cancellation never restores `TransparentOnly`. |

All other mode changes are rejected. In particular, scheduling cannot activate a
`TransparentOnly` asset, and neither registration nor a scheduled transition can
disable confidentiality after activation.

### Migration sequencing

1. **Activate verifier roles:** Register the active canonical Kagemusha verifier bindings. The first non-empty binding set moves a `TransparentOnly` asset to `Convertible` immediately.
2. **Stage a confidential-mode transition:** Submit `ScheduleConfidentialPolicyTransition` with an `effective_height` that respects `policy_transition_delay_blocks`. When moving toward `ShieldedOnly`, specify a conversion window (`window ≥ policy_transition_window_blocks`).
3. **Publish operator guidance:** Record the returned `transition_id` and circulate an on/off-ramp runbook. Wallets and auditors subscribe to `/v1/confidential/assets/{id}/transitions` to learn the window open height.
4. **Window enforcement:** The asset remains `Convertible` throughout the notice window so holders can complete public redemption before cut-over.
5. **Finalize or abort:** At `effective_height`, the runtime verifies zero transparent supply. Success flips the policy to `ShieldedOnly`; failure logs the prerequisite error, clears the pending transition, and leaves the current confidential mode unchanged.
6. **Persist the canonical state:** After a successful transition, operators archive the
   verifier registrations, `RegisterZkAsset` instruction, transition receipt, and resulting
   policy fingerprint. Asset-registration manifests never carry `confidential_policy` state.

New networks that start with confidentiality enabled register each asset transparently, then
include active canonical verifying-key records followed by `RegisterZkAsset` in genesis. The
runtime derives the initial confidential policy only after validating those bindings. Networks
still follow the checklist above when changing modes post-launch so conversion windows remain
deterministic and wallets have time to adjust.

### Norito manifest versioning & activation

- Genesis manifests MUST include a `SetParameter` for the custom `confidential_registry_root` key. The payload is Norito JSON matching `ConfidentialRegistryMeta { vk_set_hash: Option<String> }`: omit the field (`null`) when no verifier entries are active, otherwise supply a 32-byte hex string (`0x…`) equal to the hash produced by `compute_vk_set_hash` over the verifier instructions shipped in the manifest. Nodes refuse to start if the parameter is missing or the hash disagrees with the encoded registry writes.
- The on-wire `ConfidentialFeatureDigest::conf_rules_version` embeds the manifest layout version. For v1 networks it MUST remain `Some(1)` and equals `iroha_config::parameters::defaults::confidential::RULES_VERSION`. When the ruleset evolves, bump the constant, regenerate manifests, and roll out binaries in lock-step; mixing versions causes validators to reject blocks with `ConfidentialFeatureDigestMismatch`.
- Activation manifests SHOULD bundle registry updates, parameter lifecycle changes, and policy transitions so the digest stays consistent:
  1. Apply the planned registry mutations (`Publish*`, `Set*Lifecycle`) in an offline state view and compute the post-activation digest with `compute_confidential_feature_digest`.
  2. Emit `SetParameter::custom(confidential_registry_root, {"vk_set_hash": "0x…"})` using the computed hash so lagging peers can recover the correct digest even if they miss intermediate registry instructions.
  3. Append the `ScheduleConfidentialPolicyTransition` instructions. Each instruction must quote the governance-issued `transition_id`; manifests that forget it will be rejected by the runtime.
  4. Persist the manifest bytes, a SHA-256 fingerprint, and the digest used in the activation plan. Operators verify all three artefacts before voting the manifest into effect to avoid partitions.
- When rollouts require a deferred cut-over, record the target height in a companion custom parameter (for example `custom.confidential_upgrade_activation_height`). This gives auditors a Norito-encoded proof that validators honoured the notice window before the digest change took effect.

## Verifier & Parameter Lifecycle
### ZK Registry
- Ledger stores `ZkVerifierEntry { vk_id, circuit_id, version, proving_system, curve, public_inputs_schema_hash, vk_hash, vk_len, max_proof_bytes, gas_schedule_id, activation_height, deprecation_height, withdraw_height, status, metadata_uri_cid, vk_bytes_cid }` where `proving_system` is currently fixed to `Halo2`.
- `(circuit_id, version)` pairs are globally unique; the registry maintains a secondary index for lookups by circuit metadata. Attempts to register a duplicate pair are rejected during admission.
- `circuit_id` must be non-empty and `public_inputs_schema_hash` must be provided (typically a Blake2b-32 hash of the verifier’s canonical public-input encoding). Admission rejects records that omit these fields.
- Governance instructions include:
  - `PUBLISH` to add a `Proposed` entry with metadata only.
  - `ACTIVATE { vk_id, activation_height }` to schedule entry activation at an epoch boundary.
  - `DEPRECATE { vk_id, deprecation_height }` to mark the final height where proofs may reference the entry.
  - `WITHDRAW { vk_id, withdraw_height }` for emergency shutdown; affected assets freeze confidential spending after the withdraw height until new entries activate.
- Genesis manifests auto-emit a `confidential_registry_root` custom parameter whose `vk_set_hash` matches the active entries; validation cross-checks this digest against local registry state before a node can join consensus.
- Registering or updating a verifier requires a `gas_schedule_id`; verification enforces that the registry entry is `Active`, present in the `(circuit_id, version)` index, and that Halo2 proofs provide an `OpenVerifyEnvelope` whose `circuit_id`, `vk_hash`, and `public_inputs_schema_hash` match the registry record. Registry, proof-attachment admission, checked verifier guardrails, and IVM host verifier snapshots reject explicit trusted-setup labels such as Groth16, Halo2/BN254, Halo2/BLS12, and Halo2/KZG; the admitted production verifier families are transparent Halo2 IPA over Pasta and STARK/FRI.
- Kagemusha transfer-v2 and redemption proof admission requires canonical Halo2 IPA `OpenVerifyEnvelope` metadata before public inputs are parsed: backend tag, circuit id, public-input schema bytes, verifier-key hash, empty auxiliary bytes, and active `(circuit_id, version)` registry mapping must match the protocol-global transfer role or the asset-bound redemption role as appropriate. The shared Halo2 IPA backend verifier also rejects non-empty auxiliary bytes, zero or mismatched `vk_hash` values, and mismatched `ProofBox.backend` labels before proof verification. The lightweight preverify/dedup path applies the same envelope-metadata guard for recognized proof envelopes before cache insertion and leaves Groth16, Halo2/BN254, and Halo2/KZG labels unsupported, so malformed failed preverify attempts cannot occupy the key for a later valid proof; checked verifier guardrails reject those labels before backend dispatch as well.
- The inner Halo2/IPA binary envelope treats its redundant public-input count and byte length as one canonical shape: every input is exactly 32 bytes and decoding requires `pi_len == n_pi * 32` before slicing or allocating public-input storage. Aligned shorter or longer declarations and misaligned lengths are rejected; they are never reinterpreted as the magic-disjoint `ZK1\0` TLV layout.

### Proving Keys
- Proving keys remain off-ledger but are referenced by content-addressed identifiers (`pk_cid`, `pk_hash`, `pk_len`) published alongside verifier metadata.
- Wallet SDKs fetch PK data, verify hashes, and cache locally.

### Pedersen & Poseidon Parameters
- Separate registries (`PedersenParams`, `PoseidonParams`) mirror verifier lifecycle controls, each with `params_id`, hashes of generators/constants, activation, deprecation, and withdraw heights.

## Deterministic Ordering & Nullifiers
- Each registered asset persists `ConfidentialTreeProfile::PoseidonPastaV1` in
  `ZkAssetState`. This fixed-depth Pasta Poseidon profile is the only
  first-release tree construction. `RegisterZkAsset` validates every configured
  Kagemusha top-up and unshield verifier against it; key rotation may retain
  the profile, but no populated asset can switch profiles.
- All Kagemusha top-up, transfer, and unshield-change append paths use the same
  profile-aware batch operation. `ZkAssetState` persists a fixed 16-slot
  incremental frontier and the current root. A hot append validates that
  constant-size metadata and the retained-history tail, validates every new
  scalar, simulates the complete batch on a copied frontier, reserves storage,
  and only then extends the ordered commitment and root vectors. It neither
  clones nor rehashes the prior commitment prefix; work is
  `O(batch * tree_depth)`. Blocks therefore append commitments deterministically
  in transaction order and in each proof's canonical authenticated output
  order, without leaving a partial prefix after capacity, allocation, or
  commitment validation fails.
- Snapshot decode/recovery and explicitly admitted audits perform the separate
  full integrity tier. They build one compact projection from the ordered
  commitment prefix, compare its root and exact frontier with the persisted
  metadata, and validate retained roots and checkpoints. Hot consensus writes
  never substitute that linear rebuild for incremental validation.
- `note_position` is derived from the tree offsets but **not** part of the nullifier; it only feeds membership paths within the proof witness.
- Nullifier stability under reorgs is guaranteed by the PRF design; the PRF input binds `{ nk, note_preimage_hash, asset_id, network_id, params_id }`, and anchors reference historical Merkle roots limited by `max_anchor_age_blocks`.

### V1 public-amount proof scalars

The generic `Shield`, `ZkTransfer`, and `Unshield` wires are retired.
Public-to-confidential and confidential-to-public amounts are carried inside
the scale-bound, proof-authenticated Kagemusha V4 top-up and redeem requests.
The direct `SubmitZkAceAuthorizedTransfer` instruction is retired. ZK-ACE callers instead
select an active governed `PrivacyZkAcePolicyRecordV1`; the canonical native
builder binds an atomic `u128` amount into
`ZkAcePqAuthorizationStatementV1`, wraps the statement and proof in exactly one
`SubmitPrivacyProofV1`, and signs that complete transaction.

The signed path rejects zero, fractional, noncanonical, and over-`u128` input
before proof construction. Runtime admission then revalidates the signed
transaction intent, compiled protocol profile, governed policy and
authorization epoch, statement amount, proof, and replay nullifier before any
balance mutation. Supporting fractional or wider public amounts in a future
ZK-ACE circuit requires an explicitly versioned statement schema and migration
plan.

### Protocol-private transfer and redemption proofs

The confidential transfer and redemption circuits remain reusable cryptographic
components, but their proof envelopes are not executable instructions.
Transfer-v2 is selected only as a protocol-global component of the typed
Kagemusha recursive proof. Kagemusha redemption owns the asset-bound redemption
verifier and couples every successful proof to anchor drawdown and an equal
debit from deterministic offline escrow before public credit.

This separation is a consensus invariant. A proof that is sound for the note
tree does not by itself authorize settlement against a particular backing
pool, so no generic dispatch, InstructionBox discriminant, IVM bridge, relay,
CLI command, or SDK transaction builder may expose either circuit directly.

## Ledger Flow
1. **TopUpKagemushaRecursiveV4 { request }**
   - Requires `Convertible` policy and an asset-bound canonical `vk_shield`.
     Runtime validates the payer and device authorization, active release,
     exact scale and amount, fresh note, authoritative roots and leaf index,
     verifier binding, and top-up proof.
   - Public funds move into operation-bound escrow and the proof-bound note is
     appended atomically. Any failed check leaves both balances and the tree unchanged.
2. **RedeemKagemushaRecursiveV4 { request }**
   - Requires the authenticated Kagemusha device/release path and
     an asset-bound canonical `vk_unshield`. The proof binds the note spend and
     public amount; Core atomically consumes nullifiers, draws down the
     originating anchors, debits offline escrow, and credits the designated
     public account.
   - A proof failure, stale/replayed request, insufficient backing, or anchor
     mismatch leaves the nullifier set, tree, escrow, and public balance unchanged.
## Data Model Additions
- `ConfidentialConfig` (new config section) with enablement flag, `assume_valid`, gas/limit knobs, anchor window, verifier backend.
- `ConfidentialNote`, `ConfidentialTransfer`, and `ConfidentialMint` Norito schemas with explicit version byte (`CONFIDENTIAL_ASSET_V1 = 0x01`).
- `ConfidentialEncryptedPayload` wraps AEAD memo bytes with `{ version, ephemeral_pubkey, nonce, ciphertext }`, defaulting to `version = CONFIDENTIAL_ENCRYPTED_PAYLOAD_V1` for the XChaCha20-Poly1305 layout.
- Canonical positive key-derivation vectors for nonzero spend keys live in `specs/confidential_key_vectors.json`; both the CLI and Torii endpoint regress against these fixtures. Wallet-facing derivatives and negative all-zero spend-key admission coverage for the spend/nullifier/viewing ladder are published in `fixtures/confidential/keyset_derivation_v1.json` and exercised by the Rust + Swift SDK tests to guarantee cross-language parity.
- Registered `asset::AssetDefinition` state contains
  `confidential_policy: AssetConfidentialPolicy { mode, vk_set_hash,
  poseidon_params_id, pedersen_params_id, pending_transition }`. The public
  `NewAssetDefinition` registration payload deliberately omits this field and
  always builds `TransparentOnly` state with no pending transition;
  `RegisterZkAsset` is the only confidential activation path.
- `ZkAssetState` persists the sole first-release tree profile, an exact
  fixed-size incremental frontier, its current root, and the `(backend, name,
  commitment)` bindings for Kagemusha top-up/redemption. The global Kagemusha
  transfer-v2 verifier is not stored as an asset binding.
  The frontier and root are required first-release snapshot fields; there is no
  legacy reconstruction fallback. Execution rejects proofs whose referenced
  verifying key fails to match the registered commitment, whose proof envelope
  does not bind the expected schema and active verifier metadata, or whose
  auxiliary bytes are non-empty. Recovery rejects populated state when a full
  commitment projection disagrees with the persisted frontier/current root or
  when retained roots and checkpoints do not authenticate under the profile.
- The ordered commitment prefix and bounded exact root suffix (per asset with
  frontier checkpoints), `NullifierSet` keyed by
  `(network_id, asset_id, nullifier)`, `ZkVerifierEntry`, `PedersenParams`, and
  `PoseidonParams` are stored in world state.
- Mempool maintains transient `NullifierIndex` and `AnchorIndex` structures for early duplicate detection and anchor age checks.
- Norito schema updates include canonical ordering for public inputs; round-trip tests ensure encoding determinism.
- Encrypted payload roundtrips are locked in via unit tests (`crates/iroha_data_model/src/confidential.rs`), and the wallet key-derivation vectors above anchor the AEAD envelope derivations for auditors. `norito.md` documents the on-wire header for the envelope.

## IVM Integration & Syscall
- Introduce `VERIFY_CONFIDENTIAL_PROOF` syscall accepting:
  - `circuit_id`, `version`, `scheme`, `public_inputs`, `proof`, and resulting `ConfidentialStateDelta { asset_id, nullifiers, commitments, enc_payloads }`.
  - Syscall loads verifier metadata from registry, enforces size/time limits, charges deterministic gas, and only applies delta if proof succeeds.
- Host exposes read-only `ConfidentialLedger` trait for retrieving Merkle root snapshots and nullifier status; Kotodama library provides witness assembly helpers and schema validation.
- Pointer-ABI docs updated to clarify proof buffer layout and registry handles.

## Node Capability Negotiation
- Handshake advertises `feature_bits.confidential` together with a `ConfidentialFeatureDigest { vk_set_hash, poseidon_params_id, pedersen_params_id, conf_rules_version }`. Validator participation requires `confidential.enabled=true`, `assume_valid=false`, identical verifier backend identifiers, and matching digests; mismatches fail the handshake with `HandshakeConfidentialMismatch`.
- Config supports `assume_valid` for observer nodes only: when disabled, encountering confidential instructions yields deterministic `UnsupportedInstruction` without panic; when enabled, observers apply declared state deltas without verifying proofs.
- Mempool rejects confidential transactions if local capability is disabled. Gossip filters avoid sending shielded transactions to peers without matching capability while blind-forwarding unknown verifier IDs within size limits.

### Reveal Pruning & Nullifier Retention Policy

Confidential ledgers must retain enough history to prove note freshness and to
replay governance-driven audits. The default policy, enforced by
`ConfidentialLedger`, is:

- **Nullifier retention:** keep spent nullifiers for *minimum* `730` days (24
  months) after spend height, or the regulator-mandated window if longer.
  Operators may extend the window via `confidential.retention.nullifier_days`.
  Nullifiers younger than the retention window MUST remain queryable via Torii so
  auditors can prove double-spend absence.
- **Public redemption:** only Kagemusha V4 redemption may move confidential
  value back to the public ledger. It consumes the authenticated nullifier,
  applies exact anchor drawdown, and transfers from the protocol escrow. The
  commitment log remains append-only; there is no generic reveal instruction
  or generic confidential lifecycle event compatibility wire.
- **Frontier checkpoints:** commitment frontiers maintain rolling checkpoints
  covering the larger of `max_anchor_age_blocks` and the retention window. Nodes
  compact older checkpoints only after all nullifiers within the interval expire.
- **Stale digest remediation:** if `HandshakeConfidentialMismatch` is raised due
  to digest drift, operators should (1) verify that nullifier retention windows
  align across the cluster, (2) run `iroha_cli app confidential verify-ledger` to
  regenerate the digest against the retained nullifier set, and (3) redeploy the
  refreshed manifest. Any nullifiers pruned prematurely must be restored from
  cold storage before rejoining the network.

Document local overrides in the operations runbook; governance policies extending
the retention window must update node configuration and archival storage plans in
lockstep.

### Eviction & Recovery Flow

1. During dial, `IrohaNetwork` compares the advertised capabilities. Any mismatch raises `HandshakeConfidentialMismatch`; the connection is closed and the peer remains in the discovery queue without ever being promoted to `Ready`.
2. The failure is surfaced via the network service log (including the remote digest and backend), and Sumeragi never schedules the peer for proposal or voting.
3. Operators remediate by aligning verifier registries and parameter sets (`vk_set_hash`, `pedersen_params_id`, `poseidon_params_id`) or by staging `next_conf_features` with an agreed `activation_height`. Once the digest matches, the next handshake succeeds automatically.
4. If a stale peer manages to broadcast a block (e.g., via archival replay), validators reject it deterministically with `BlockRejectionReason::ConfidentialFeatureDigestMismatch`, keeping ledger state consistent across the network.

### Replay-safe handshake flow

1. Each attempt negotiates a fresh SoraNet or Noise session key. The signed payload (`handshake_signature_payload`) uses an explicit V1 domain and binds the complete 256-bit domain-separated session hash, identity algorithm and public key, Norito-encoded advertised address, relay/consensus/confidential/crypto/trust capabilities, mandatory exact genesis-derived `NetworkId`, and presence/value of any TLS or QUIC certificate fingerprint. The message is AEAD-encrypted before it leaves the node.
2. The responder derives the same full session hash and verifies the long-term peer signature over those exact `HandshakeHelloV1` claims before enforcing or using them. Replaying a captured message in another session, altering a capability, connecting to a network with another genesis hash (even under the same display name), or changing the authenticated transport binding therefore fails signature verification deterministically; the compact 64-bit connection disambiguator is used only for simultaneous-connection tie-breaking.
3. Confidential capability flags and the `ConfidentialFeatureDigest` travel inside the signed `HandshakeConfidentialMeta`. After authentication, the receiver compares the tuple `{ enabled, assume_valid, verifier_backend, digest }` against its locally configured `ConfidentialHandshakeCaps`; any mismatch exits early with `HandshakeConfidentialMismatch` before the transport transitions to `Ready`.
4. Operators MUST recompute the digest (via `compute_confidential_feature_digest`) and restart nodes with the updated registries/policies before reconnecting. Peers advertising old digests continue to fail the handshake, preventing stale state from re-entering the validator set.
5. Handshake successes and failures update the standard `iroha_p2p::peer` counters (`handshake_failure_count`, error taxonomy helpers) and emit structured log entries tagged with the remote peer ID and digest fingerprint. Monitor these indicators to catch replay attempts or misconfigurations during rollout.

## Key Management & Payloads
- Per-account key derivation hierarchy:
  - `sk_spend` → `nk` (nullifier key), `ivk` (incoming viewing key), `ovk` (outgoing viewing key), `fvk`.
- Encrypted note payloads use AEAD with ECDH-derived shared keys; optional auditor view keys may be attached to outputs per asset policy.
- CLI additions: `confidential create-keys`, `confidential send`, `confidential export-view-key`, auditor tooling for decrypting memos, and the `iroha app zk envelope` helper for producing/inspecting Norito memo envelopes offline.

## Gas, Limits & DoS Controls
- Deterministic gas schedule:
  - Halo2 (Plonkish): base `250_000` gas + `2_000` gas per public input.
  - `5` gas per proof byte, plus per-nullifier (`300`) and per-commitment (`500`) charges.
  - Operators may set these constants in the node configuration (`confidential.gas.{proof_base, per_public_input, per_proof_byte, per_nullifier, per_commitment}`) before startup. The schedule is consensus-relevant and committed into the ZK policy hash, so it is read-only through `/v1/configuration`; changing it requires a coordinated configuration rollout and node restart.
- Hard limits (configurable defaults):
- `max_proof_size_bytes = 262_144`.
- `max_nullifiers_per_tx = 8`, `max_commitments_per_tx = 8`, `max_confidential_ops_per_block = 256`.
- `verify_timeout_ms = 750`, `max_anchor_age_blocks = 10_000`. `verify_timeout_ms` is an operator latency budget for telemetry and backpressure; consensus validity is determined by deterministic bounds such as proof size, gas, public input counts, registry policy, and anchor age.
- Additional quotas ensure liveness: `max_proof_bytes_block`, `max_verify_calls_per_tx`, `max_verify_calls_per_block`, and `max_public_inputs` bound block builders; `reorg_depth_bound` (≥ `max_anchor_age_blocks`) governs frontier checkpoint retention.
- Runtime execution now rejects transactions that exceed these per-transaction or per-block limits, emitting deterministic `InvalidParameter` errors and leaving ledger state unchanged.
- Mempool prefilters confidential transactions by `vk_id`, proof length, and anchor age before invoking the verifier to keep resource usage bounded.
- Verification rejects deterministic bound violations with explicit errors. SIMD backends are optional but do not alter gas accounting or validity, and local timeout observations do not change ledger outcomes.

### Calibration Baselines & Acceptance Gates
- **Reference platforms.** Calibration runs MUST cover the three hardware profiles below. Runs failing to capture all profiles are rejected during review.

  | Profile | Architecture | CPU / Instance | Compiler flags | Purpose |
  | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
  | `baseline-simd-neutral` | `x86_64` | AMD EPYC 7B12 (32c) or Intel Xeon Gold 6430 (24c) | `RUSTFLAGS="-C target-feature=-avx,-avx2,-fma"` | Establish floor values without vector intrinsics; used to tune fallback cost tables. |
  | `baseline-avx2` | `x86_64` | Intel Xeon Gold 6430 (24c) | default release | Validates AVX2 path; checks that SIMD speedups stay within tolerance of neutral gas. |
  | `baseline-neon` | `aarch64` | AWS Graviton3 (c7g.4xlarge) | default release | Ensures NEON backend remains deterministic and aligned with x86 schedules. |

- **Benchmark harness.** All gas calibration reports MUST be produced with:
  - `CRITERION_HOME=target/criterion cargo bench -p iroha_core --bench isi_gas_calibration -- --sample-size 200 --warm-up-time 5 --save-baseline <profile-label>`
  - `cargo test -p iroha_core bench_repro -- --ignored` to confirm the deterministic fixture.
  - `CRITERION_HOME=target/criterion cargo bench -p ivm --bench gas_calibration -- --sample-size 200 --warm-up-time 5 --save-baseline <profile-label>` whenever VM opcode costs change.

- **Fixed randomness.** Export `IROHA_CONF_GAS_SEED=conf-gas-seed-2026Q1` before running benches so `iroha_test_samples::gen_account_in` switches to the deterministic `KeyPair::from_seed` path. The harness prints `IROHA_CONF_GAS_SEED_ACTIVE=…` once; if the variable is missing, review MUST fail. Any new calibration utilities must continue honouring this env var when introducing auxiliary randomness.

- **Result capture.**
  - Upload Criterion summaries (`target/criterion/**/raw.csv`) for each profile into the release artefact.
  - Store derived metrics (`ns/op`, `gas/op`, `ns/gas`) in `specs/confidential_assets_calibration.md` along with the git commit and compiler version used.
  - Maintain the last two baselines per profile; delete older snapshots once the newest report is validated.

- **Acceptance tolerances.**
  - Gas deltas between `baseline-simd-neutral` and `baseline-avx2` MUST remain ≤ ±1.5%.
  - Gas deltas between `baseline-simd-neutral` and `baseline-neon` MUST remain ≤ ±2.0%.
  - Calibration proposals exceeding these thresholds require either schedule adjustments or an RFC explaining the discrepancy and mitigation.

- **Review checklist.** Submitters are responsible for:
  - Including `uname -a`, `/proc/cpuinfo` excerpts (model, stepping), and `rustc -Vv` in the calibration log.
  - Verifying `IROHA_CONF_GAS_SEED` echoed in the bench output (the benches print the active seed).
  - Ensuring pacemaker and confidential verifier feature flags mirror production (`--features confidential,telemetry` when running benches with Telemetry).

## Config & Operations
- `iroha_config` gains `[confidential]` section:
  ```toml
  [confidential]
  enabled = true
  assume_valid = false
  verifier_backend = "ark_bls12_381"
  max_proof_size_bytes = 262144
  max_nullifiers_per_tx = 8
  max_commitments_per_tx = 8
  max_confidential_ops_per_block = 256
  verify_timeout_ms = 750
  max_anchor_age_blocks = 10000
  max_proof_bytes_block = 1048576
  max_verify_calls_per_tx = 128
  max_verify_calls_per_block = 128
  max_public_inputs = 32
  reorg_depth_bound = 10000
  policy_transition_delay_blocks = 100
  policy_transition_window_blocks = 200
  policy_transition_max_per_height = 256
  tree_roots_history_len = 10000
  tree_frontier_checkpoint_interval = 100
  registry_max_vk_entries = 64
  registry_max_params_entries = 32
  registry_max_delta_per_block = 4
  ```
  The default per-transaction verifier-call cap admits one complete production-shaped Soracloud BFV full-bootstrap execution proof batch, which can verify one proof per registered identifier slot. Keep the per-block cap aligned with the desired number of heavy confidential jobs per block.
- Telemetry emits aggregate metrics: `confidential_proof_verified`, `confidential_verifier_latency_ms`, `confidential_proof_bytes_total`, `confidential_nullifier_spent`, `confidential_commitments_appended`, `confidential_mempool_rejected_total{reason}`, and `confidential_policy_transitions_total`, never exposing plaintext data.
- RPC surfaces:
  - `GET /confidential/capabilities`
  - `GET /confidential/zk_registry`
  - `GET /confidential/params`

## Testing Strategy
- Determinism: randomized transaction shuffling within blocks yields identical Merkle roots and nullifier sets.
- Reorg resilience: simulate multi-block reorgs with anchors; nullifiers remain stable and stale anchors rejected.
- Gas invariants: verify identical gas usage across nodes with and without SIMD acceleration.
- Boundary testing: proofs at size/gas ceilings, max in/out counts, and telemetry latency-budget reporting.
- Lifecycle: governance operations for verifier and parameter activation/deprecation, rotation spend tests.
- Policy FSM: allowed/disallowed transitions, pending transition delays, and mempool rejection around effective heights.
- Registry emergencies: emergency withdrawal freezes affected assets at `withdraw_height` and rejects proofs afterwards.
- Capability gating: validators with mismatched `conf_features` reject blocks; observers with `assume_valid=true` keep up without affecting consensus.
- State equivalence: validator/full/observer nodes produce identical state roots on the canonical chain.
- Authenticated outputs: full-unshield V2 admits no private output;
  change-unshield V3 inserts only its proof-bound zero-or-one change commitment;
  retired, substituted, missing, extra, and reordered output layouts fail before
  effects.
- Tree integrity and atomicity: mixed/profile-changing verifier registrations,
  retained-root or checkpoint drift, and over-capacity multi-output batches fail
  without changing commitments, roots, checkpoints, nullifiers, balances,
  metadata, or events. Operation-count regressions require exactly one leaf hash
  and `tree_depth` parent hashes per appended commitment, independently of the
  prior tree size. Restart and reorg tests preserve the exact persisted profile,
  fixed frontier, current root, and checkpoint tuple.
- Negative fuzzing: malformed proofs, oversized payloads, and nullifier collisions reject deterministically.

## Outstanding Work
- Benchmark Halo2 parameter sets (circuit size, lookup strategy) and record the results in the calibration playbook so gas/timeout defaults can be updated alongside the next `confidential_assets_calibration.md` refresh.
- Finalize auditor disclosure policies and associated selective-viewing APIs, wiring the approved workflow into Torii once the governance draft is signed off.
- Extend the witness encryption scheme to cover multi-recipient outputs and batched memos, documenting the envelope format for SDK implementers.
- Commission an external security review of circuits, registries, and parameter-rotation procedures and archive the findings next to the internal audit reports.
- Specify auditor spentness reconciliation APIs and publish view-key scope guidance so wallet vendors can implement the same attestation semantics.

## Implementation Phasing
1. **Phase M0 — Stop-Ship Hardening**
   - ✅ Nullifier derivation now follows the Poseidon PRF design (`nk`, `rho`, `asset_id`, exact genesis-derived `network_id`) with deterministic commitment ordering enforced in ledger updates.
   - ✅ Execution enforces proof size caps and per-transaction/per-block confidential quotas, rejecting over-budget transactions with deterministic errors.
   - ✅ P2P handshake advertises `ConfidentialFeatureDigest` (backend digest + registry fingerprints) and fails mismatches deterministically via `HandshakeConfidentialMismatch`.
   - ✅ Remove panics in confidential execution paths and add role gating for nodes without matching capability.
  - ⚪ Expose verifier timeout budgets and enforce reorg depth bounds for frontier checkpoints.
     - Verification timeout budgets are telemetry/operator budgets only; proofs fail deterministically on size, gas, public input, policy, or anchor-age bounds.
     - ✅ Frontier checkpoints now respect `reorg_depth_bound`, pruning checkpoints older than the configured window while keeping deterministic snapshots.
   - Introduce `AssetConfidentialPolicy`, policy FSM, and enforcement gates for mint/transfer/reveal instructions.
   - Commit `conf_features` in block headers and refuse validator participation when registry/parameter digests diverge.
2. **Phase M1 — Registries & Parameters**
   - Land `ZkVerifierEntry`, `PedersenParams`, and `PoseidonParams` registries with governance ops, genesis anchoring, and cache management.
   - Wire syscall to require registry lookups, gas schedule IDs, schema hashing, and size checks.
   - Ship encrypted payload format v1, wallet key derivation vectors, and CLI support for confidential key management.
3. **Phase M2 — Gas & Performance**
   - Implement deterministic gas schedule, per-block counters, and benchmark harnesses with telemetry (verify latency, proof sizes, mempool rejections).
   - Harden CommitmentTree checkpoints, LRU loading, and nullifier indices for multi-asset workloads.
4. **Phase M3 — Rotation & Wallet Tooling**
   - Enable multi-parameter and multi-version proof acceptance; support governance-driven activation/deprecation with transition runbooks.
   - Deliver wallet SDK/CLI migration flows, auditor scanning workflows, and spentness reconciliation tooling.
5. **Phase M4 — Audit & Ops**
   - Provide auditor key workflows, selective disclosure APIs, and operational runbooks.
   - Schedule external cryptography/security review and publish findings in `status.md`.

Each phase updates roadmap milestones and associated tests to maintain deterministic execution guarantees for the blockchain network.

### SDK & Fixture Coverage (Phase M1)

Encrypted payload v1 ships with canonical fixtures so every SDK produces the
same Norito memo envelope. Transaction parity is exercised by the dedicated
Kagemusha suite; there is deliberately no generic confidential wallet-flow
fixture or encoder:

```bash
# Rust memo-envelope parity
cargo test -p iroha_data_model --test confidential_encrypted_payload_vectors

# Swift memo-envelope parity
cd IrohaSwift && swift test --filter ConfidentialEncryptedPayloadTests
```

The release-surface guards reject the retired generic and anonymous-escrow type
names and wire fingerprints while retaining the specialized Kagemusha
instructions. Updating the encrypted-payload fixture without bumping its format
version fails parity suites, keeping the SDKs and Rust codec in lock-step.

#### Wallet and SDK builders

SDKs expose authenticated Kagemusha V4 top-up/redemption. They do not expose
generic `Shield`, `ZkTransfer`, `Unshield`, or native anonymous-escrow requests
or encoders. SDK manifests and generated
instruction catalogs must omit all three retired data-model types and their
wire fingerprints.

`vk_shield` and `vk_unshield` are optional asset-registration bindings whose
presence enables only their narrow protocol roles described above. There is no
asset-bound transfer verifier. Wallet implementations must build and sign
the complete specialized request; a proof envelope, amount, nullifier list, or
opaque commitment is never sufficient authority on its own.

### Telemetry & Monitoring (Phase M2)

Phase M2 now exports CommitmentTree health directly via Prometheus and Grafana:

- `iroha_confidential_tree_commitments`, `iroha_confidential_tree_depth`, `iroha_confidential_root_history_entries`, and `iroha_confidential_frontier_checkpoints` expose the live Merkle frontier per asset while `iroha_confidential_root_evictions_total` / `iroha_confidential_frontier_evictions_total` count the LRU trims enforced by `confidential.tree_roots_history_len` and the checkpoint depth window.
- `iroha_confidential_frontier_last_checkpoint_height` and `iroha_confidential_frontier_last_checkpoint_commitments` publish the height + commitment count of the most recent frontier checkpoint so reorg drills and rollbacks can prove that checkpoints advance and retain the expected payload volume.
- The Grafana board (`dashboards/grafana/confidential_assets.json`) includes a depth series, eviction-rate panels, and the existing verifier cache widgets so operators can prove that CommitmentTree depth never collapses even as checkpoints churn.
- Alert `ConfidentialTreeDepthZero` (in `dashboards/alerts/confidential_assets_rules.yml`) trips once commitments are observed but the reported depth sticks at zero for five minutes.

You can verify the metrics locally before wiring Grafana:

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8180/metrics \
  | rg 'iroha_confidential_(tree_(commitments|depth)|root_history_entries|frontier_(checkpoints|last_checkpoint_height|last_checkpoint_commitments)|root_evictions_total|frontier_evictions_total){asset_id="4cuvDVPuLBKJyN6dPbRQhmLh68sU"}'
```

Pair this with `rg 'iroha_confidential_tree_depth'` on the same scrape to confirm that depth grows with new commitments while eviction counters only increase when the history caps trim entries. These values must line up with the Grafana dashboard export you attach to governance evidence bundles.

#### Gas schedule telemetry & alerts

Phase M2 also threads the configurable gas multipliers into the telemetry pipeline so operators can prove that every validator shares the same verification costs before approving a release:

- `iroha_confidential_gas_base_verify` mirrors `confidential.gas.proof_base` (default `250_000`).
- `iroha_confidential_gas_per_public_input`, `iroha_confidential_gas_per_proof_byte`, `iroha_confidential_gas_per_nullifier`, and `iroha_confidential_gas_per_commitment` mirror their respective knobs in `ConfidentialConfig`. `irohad` publishes the startup schedule through `Telemetry::set_confidential_gas_schedule`. The schedule is read-only at runtime because it is committed into the ZK policy hash.

Scrape the gauges alongside the CommitmentTree metrics to confirm the knobs are identical across peers:

```bash
# compare active multipliers across validators
for host in validator-a validator-b validator-c; do
  curl -s "http://$host:8180/metrics" \
    | rg 'iroha_confidential_gas_(base_verify|per_public_input|per_proof_byte|per_nullifier|per_commitment)'
done
```

Grafana dashboard `confidential_assets.json` now includes a “Gas Schedule” panel that renders the five gauges and highlights divergence. Alert rules in `dashboards/alerts/confidential_assets_rules.yml` cover:
- `ConfidentialGasMismatch`: checks the max/min of each multiplier across all scrape targets and pages when any diverge for more than 3 minutes, prompting operators to align `confidential.gas` and perform a coordinated node restart.
- `ConfidentialGasTelemetryMissing`: warns when Prometheus cannot scrape any of the five multipliers for 5 minutes, indicating a missing scrape target or disabled telemetry.

Keep the following PromQL handy for on-call investigations:

```promql
# ensure every multiplier matches across validators (uses the same projection as the alert)
(max without(instance, job) (iroha_confidential_gas_per_public_input)
  - min without(instance, job) (iroha_confidential_gas_per_public_input)) == 0
```

Deviation should remain zero outside of controlled config rollouts. When changing the gas table, use a coordinated validator restart, capture before/after scrapes, attach them to the change request, and update `specs/confidential_assets_calibration.md` with the new multipliers so governance reviewers can link the telemetry evidence to the calibration report.

# Mochi implementation boundaries

Mochi is an egui desktop over the shared Kagami managed workspace. It does not
own a second genesis renderer, child-process supervisor, signer vault, compiler
or deployment journal. See [the source ownership and regression checks](../mochi/README.md).

`iroha_deploy::managed` persists a workspace-scoped context under the operating
system's application-state directory, generates a four-validator network using
the canonical localnet generator, and authenticates its native background
worker. Aggregate Start/Stop retain identity and ledger; explicit stopped-network
Reset removes the generation. Closing the desktop leaves the worker running.

`mochi-core::developer::ManagedNetwork` captures a validated generation and its
exact client/operator authorities. State queries, transaction composition and
SDK block/event readers use the generated account. The operator key is separate
and must match all four generated Torii configs. A reset invalidates captured
observers/previews; no automatic switch to a replacement authority occurs.

Desktop deployment uses Musubi's presentation-free runtime, then the canonical
`iroha_contract_deploy` service. A review channel exposes the exact fees and
signed transaction hashes before dispatch. Closing the review cancels; successful
receipts require original-hash Applied evidence and matching artifact/alias
readback. Recovery reviews the retained plan without rebuilding it.

Native filesystem custody is owned by `iroha_fs`; process ownership and IPC by
`iroha_deploy`. Runtime secrets never appear in project files or public desktop
metadata. The installed matching binaries are required for lifecycle actions;
startup performs no build or dependency download.

The private-dataspace action selects an independently installed network profile
and delegates provisioning and outbound parent publication to the same managed
worker as Kagami. Local readiness, pending parent work and independently verified
historical parent receipts have separate display states. The desktop neither
chooses a trust key from a response nor writes parent wallets or journals itself.
Contract package resolution requests the authenticated parent registry lazily;
local source and complete cached package graphs require no parent request.

An official Taira profile, native platform qualification and whole-network privacy
and latency checks remain outstanding in
[the shared implementation goals](kagami_mochi_devex_goals.md). Implemented desktop
actions do not establish those release results.

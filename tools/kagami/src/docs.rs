                              `Option<..>` or in a double `Option<Option<..>>`. For the detailed explanation, please refer to \
                              this [section](#configuration-types).\n")?;

                 ### `Option<..>`\n\n\
                 A type wrapped in a single `Option<..>` signifies that in the corresponding `json` block there is a fallback value for this type, \
                 and that it only serves as a reference. If a default for such a type has a `null` value, it means that there is no meaningful fallback \
                 available for this particular value.\n\nAll the default values can be freely obtained from a provided [sample configuration file](../../../configs/peer/config.json), \
                 but it should only serve as a starting point. If left unchanged, the sample configuration file would still fail to build due to it having `null` in place of \
                 [public](#public_key) and [private](#private_key) keys as well as [API endpoint URL](#torii.api_url). \
                 These should be provided either by modifying the sample config file or as environment variables. \
                 No other overloading of configuration values happens besides reading them from a file and capturing the environment variables.\n\n\
                 For both types of configuration options wrapped in a single `Option<..>` (i.e. both those that have meaningful defaults and those that have `null`), \
                 failure to provide them in any of the above two ways results in an error.\n\n\
                 ### `Option<Option<..>>`\n\n\
                 `Option<Option<..>>` types should be distinguished from types wrapped in a single `Option<..>`. Only the double option ones are allowed to stay `null`, \
                 meaning that **not** providing them in an environment variable or a file will **not** result in an error.\n\n\
                 Thus, only these types are truly optional in the mundane sense of the word. \
                 An example of this distinction is genesis [public](#genesis.account_public_key) and [private](#genesis.account_private_key) key. \
                 While the first one is a single `Option<..>` wrapped type, the latter is wrapped in `Option<Option<..>>`. This means that the genesis *public* key should always be \
                 provided by the user, be it via a file config or an environment variable, whereas the *private* key is only needed for the peer that submits the genesis block, \
                 and can be omitted for all others. The same logic goes for other double option fields such as logger file path.\n\n\
                 ### Sumeragi: default `null` values\n\n\
                 A special note about sumeragi fields with `null` as default: only the [`trusted_peers`](#sumeragi.trusted_peers) field out of the three can be initialized via a \
                 provided file or an environment variable.\n\n\
                 The other two fields, namely [`key_pair`](#sumeragi.key_pair) and [`peer_id`](#sumeragi.peer_id), go through a process of finalization where their values \
                 are derived from the corresponding ones in the uppermost Iroha config (using its [`public_key`](#public_key) and [`private_key`](#private_key) fields) \
                 or the Torii config (via its [`p2p_addr`](#torii.p2p_addr)). \
                 This ensures that these linked fields stay in sync, and prevents the programmer error when different values are provided to these field pairs. \
                 Providing either `sumeragi.key_pair` or `sumeragi.peer_id` by hand will result in an error, as it should never be done directly.\n"

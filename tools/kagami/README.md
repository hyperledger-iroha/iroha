# Kagami (Teacher and Exemplar and/or Looking glass)

Kagami is a tool used to generate and validate automatically generated data files that are shipped with Iroha.

## Usage

As it is an internal tool with no stable API, we decided to move all the documentation into the CLI help messages and keep it up to date in a single place.

Run `kagami --help` for usage details:

```bash
cargo run --release --bin kagami -- --help
```

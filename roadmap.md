# Roadmap (Open Work Only)

Last updated: 2026-04-28

Completed history lives in `status.md`. This file should only track unfinished work.

## Validation corridor

- Carry Offline V2 real-proof support through the remaining release corridor.
  - Fold the new prover slice into a broader `cargo test -p iroha_core --lib`, SDK test, and workspace clippy corridor when validation budget allows.
- Carry native asset escrow through the remaining Aitai application corridor.
  - Wire the Sora Aitai application UI/backend onto the native numeric escrow ISIs and proof-carrying anonymous escrow helper surfaces, then subscribe through the numeric and anonymous escrow query/event APIs.
  - Add app-facing lifecycle events for transparent and shielded offer state changes, and keep any remaining Kotodama wrapper work scoped to app calls that still need contract compatibility.
  - Add end-to-end UI/client smoke coverage once the Sora Aitai application replaces the old contract escrow account path for both transparent XOR and shielded anonymous-asset offers.
  - Rerun the full Kotlin, Java Android, and Swift SDK suites after the Aitai app wiring lands and a Java 21 runtime is available in the validation shell.
  - Keep NFT/RWA escrow and court fee/payout generalization as separate follow-ups; the v1 primitive intentionally resolves only between the escrow seller and accepted buyer.
- Carry the Soracloud production posture hardening through the operator-host rollout corridor.
  - Local focused, portable QEMU, and prior multi-peer load gates are green as of 2026-04-25; the readiness runner now reports missing operator inventory and missing observability evidence as production blockers. Before public rollout, run the mixed-host Inrou smoke with the real operator inventory, attach the real metrics/status/alert/dashboard evidence, and archive a blocker-free readiness report.
- Carry the new Taira devex CLI through the opt-in live rollout corridor.
  - The local CLI/Torii/mock-script validation for `iroha taira doctor` and `iroha taira write-canary` is green as of 2026-04-25, but no live Taira write was run from this tree.
  - Before publishing a live receipt, run `iroha taira doctor --public-root https://taira.sora.org` and an operator-approved `iroha taira write-canary --public-root https://taira.sora.org`, preserving only the redacted receipt and any stable failure codes.
  - Fold the Taira CLI/Torii changes into the next broader `cargo test -p iroha_cli`, `cargo test -p iroha_torii`, workspace test, and clippy corridor when validation budget allows.
- Carry the verified lane relay JSON-state/key change through the next UC6 integration corridor.
  - The focused crate checks are green as of 2026-04-24, but no live UC6 settlement-smoke run or topology reset has been performed from this tree.
  - Before any live deployment, confirm the deploy/Core API smoke path still uses `relay_state_key`, JSON relay state, and the simulation gate against the exact finalization payload.
  - If a topology plan selects reset mode while validating this change, stop before approval and reassess the rollout scope.
- Carry the Torii routed-read and telemetry fixes through the next workspace validation corridor.
  - The crate-local sweep is green as of 2026-04-24 with `cargo test -p iroha_torii --lib --features app_api,telemetry -- --nocapture`.
  - When validation budget allows, carry the alias-routing and Torii telemetry slices through the next `cargo test --workspace` / `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` corridor and record the result in `status.md`.
- Broaden validation for the new canonical account-alias lease flow beyond the focused onboarding and executor checks.
  - The onboarding auto-renew path now grants the subscriber `CanModifyNftMetadata` for the subscription NFT before trigger registration; rerun a wider `cargo test -p iroha_torii` window with the new `/v1/accounts/{account_id}/aliases`, `/renew`, and `/auto-renew` handlers enabled.
  - Add or rerun focused coverage for user-signed enable/disable mutation flows and the SNS subscription auto-renew billing path in `crates/iroha_core/src/smartcontracts/ivm/host.rs`, not just the onboarding enqueue path.
  - Once the alias lease slice is stable under those focused reruns, fold it into the next broader `cargo test --workspace` / `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` corridor.
- Broaden validation after the 2026-04-22 targeted `sumeragi::main_loop` regression sweep and follow-up unit coverage additions.
  - Rerun a wider `cargo test -p iroha_core --lib` window now that the reported 10-case failure cluster is green under focused verification.
  - Keep the new collector-disabled fallback, seeded-collector precommit fallback, near-quorum full-fanout retransmit helper test, signer-mapping failure full-fanout fallback test, local-vote replay suppression, direct `known_block_commit_qc_recovery_targets(...)` fallbacks, direct `frontier_body_next_due(...)` deadline/fallback coverage, the direct deterministic roster-election guard tests, the direct NPoS empty-commit-topology candidate-source tests, the direct "no new progress" replay-suppression test, the direct replay-cooldown suppression test, the direct local-only explicit-target replay test, the direct deduplicated explicit-target vote replay test, the direct local-only explicit-target commit-QC replay test, the local-proposal authoritative-frontier fallback test, the local-proposal first-signature fallback test, the generic proposal-wire authoritative-frontier fallback and mismatch-guard tests, the plain `frontier_block_created_for_wire(...)` no-metadata fallback test, and the expanded cached-target / unarmed / local-only `frontier_body_next_due(...)` tests in the rerun window so the next pass exercises both the regression fixtures and the new narrow branch tests together.
  - If that broader rerun exposes follow-up regressions outside the patched collector / frontier / roster slice, capture the first failing test names and keep the next fix narrowly scoped.
- Reopen the wider validation corridor after the recent focused `iroha_core`, `iroha_torii`, and `iroha_data_model` test additions.
  - Rerun `cargo test -p iroha_core --lib`, including `quorum_reschedule_rebroadcasts_block_created_while_skipping_block_sync_without_roster_proof` in a fresh cargo process.
  - Rerun `cargo test -p iroha_torii` and `cargo test -p integration_tests -- --nocapture` once the current tree is stable enough for network suites.
  - When validation budget allows, rerun `cargo test --workspace` and `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`, then capture failures or green status in `status.md`.

## Consensus and Izanami

- Maintain Izanami communication vulnerability publication evidence.
  - The exact-injector 75% packet-loss 2026-04-26 paper-shaped run at `dist/izanami-exact-packet-paper-20260426` is green for both permissioned and NPoS Sumeragi and is recorded in `status.md`; keep this as the current full-matrix resilience baseline.
  - Native in-process P2P packet-drop injection is wired into `packet-loss` and leader-targeted `leader-isolation`; the matrix runner now supports the paper's 133s-266s timed fault window plus configurable packet-loss sweeps (`75%` quick, `25%/50%/75%` paper). The explicit 25%/50%/75% paper packet-loss sweep at `dist/izanami-packet-sweep-paper-20260427-loss-only` is green for both permissioned and NPoS Sumeragi and is recorded in `status.md`.
  - The 2026-04-27 quick matrix at `dist/izanami-quick-both-20260427` is green for all ten permissioned/NPoS rows, and the post-ingress-hardening leader-isolation rerun at `dist/izanami-quick-leader-retry-20260427` keeps both modes resilient with zero acceptance markers.
  - Keep any future publication reruns split with `--sumeragi-mode both` so permissioned and NPoS Sumeragi classifications are not collapsed, and preserve per-loss packet-loss subrows when comparing against the paper's Algorand/Aptos/Avalanche/Redbelly/Solana baseline.
- Recalibrate the Izanami stable-profile acceptance envelope for sustained workload targets.
  - The fresh 4-peer permissioned `1 TPS` / `300s` / `100 blocks` gate at `dist/izanami-stable-gate-20260427-target100` is green and recorded in `status.md`.
  - The matching `200`-block diagnostic at `dist/izanami-stable-gate-20260427-rerun` crossed the prior stall region and reached strict/quorum height `107` with zero submission or confirmation failures, but missed the target because the stable workload drained before `200` blocks.
  - Before the longer `3600s` / `2000+` block acceptance pass, choose a sustained-workload gate or lower short-run target so the KPI measures liveness instead of exhaustion of submitted work.
- Root-cause the remaining NPoS soak/localnet collapse instead of keeping it as a log-only symptom.
  - Reproduce with preserved peer dirs and `iroha_futures::supervisor=debug`.
  - Identify the first exiting supervised child before investigating downstream connection refusals.
  - Cross-check peer logs with `/v1/sumeragi/status` counters so the fix targets the actual failing layer.

## Throughput and query performance

- Re-establish current throughput knees for the de-amplified harness and shared-host localnet.
  - Rerun the stepped single-host sweep.
  - Repeat permissioned and NPoS passes on the same hardware envelope and compare against the archived `25-50 TPS` / `75-100 TPS` baselines.
  - Record the new knee points and any regressions in `status.md`.
- Turn the proposal-gap / queue-pressure investigation into a reproducible measurement pass.
  - Rerun the 7-peer load that previously advanced slowly or stalled under backlog.
  - Sample `/v1/sumeragi/status`, pending-block / commit-inflight metrics, and queue depths throughout the run.
  - Use a load generator that can actually sustain the target rate before changing worker/backlog tuning again.
- Rebaseline sorted asset-definition query performance.
  - Rerun `snapshot_ephemeral_sorted_asset_defs_first_batch` and `snapshot_stored_sorted_asset_defs_first_batch` on an isolated host.
  - If stored-mode still regresses, tune `stored_sorted_fast_start_params` / first-batch thresholds and keep the matching query tests aligned.
  - Restore a green `cargo test -p iroha_core` baseline for the query-performance branch after any tuning.

## Targeted follow-ups

- Broaden alias auto-renew mutation coverage beyond the focused onboarding grant.
  - Add an integration test proving a user-signed enable/disable update can mutate the subscription NFT created by onboarding.
  - If a non-onboarding mutation path still hits `Can't modify NFT from domain owned by another account`, capture the exact submitter, NFT id, and permission token shape before changing the permission model again.
- Add a live multi-peer multisig test for previously unregistered signatories.
  - Start from the existing materialization coverage in `integration_tests/tests/multisig.rs`.
  - Add a case where a signatory is materialized by registration and then successfully authors `MultisigPropose` / `MultisigApprove` on the network.
  - Assert transaction-authority shape and final instruction execution, not only account materialization.
- Verify the deterministic Sumeragi formal CI source of truth.
  - Rerun `bash ci/check_sumeragi_formal.sh` and record the exact Apalache version or digest in `status.md`.
- Extend and burn down the translation metadata audit backlog.
  - The new `ci/check_docs_i18n_metadata.py` gate covers `docs/formal`; refresh the stale `docs/formal` translations or decide when to turn on `--require-current`.
  - Clean the existing `docs/source` and `docs/portal` metadata debt, including files missing `source_hash` and `translation_last_reviewed`, before adding those trees to the CI gate.
  - Refresh only the files the checker flags, then record the clean audit command in `status.md`.
- Add a recorded capture gate for the default `sora-temple` petal styles.
  - Use `petal score-styles` with a published style set, profile, seed, and minimum success ratio.
  - Record the JSON baseline in `status.md` and keep the default style honest under aggressive capture.
  - Only add a stronger default variant if the current `sora-temple` family cannot meet the agreed gate.

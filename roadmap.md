# Roadmap

Outstanding outcomes for Iroha 3's first release. [Status](status.md) records
current health and blockers. Owners below are code responsibilities; completion
requires the stated behavior on the same candidate. Detailed acceptance lives in
the linked specifications. Routine repair receipts belong in PRs and CI.

## Current priorities

1. Rebuild and qualify the Nexus proposal projection, retained peer context,
   telemetry/status retirement and restricted lane gossip on the real workload;
   measure repeated accepted settlements.
2. Complete original funded execution through State/World acquisition,
   certification, Kura publication and restart; finish DS-local State and AMX.
3. Qualify Sumeragi and authenticated Linux artifacts; extend Taira's verified
   four-validator readiness, paid writes and rolling restart to DPN/contracts.
4. Validate the combined fixture/runtime repairs through fresh workspace,
   genuine fixture and native SDK artifacts on one source candidate. Qualify the
   joint X509 relation and transcript privacy, and resolve its proving-time and
   hardware-specific address-space failures;
   produce current q77 maximum proofs without widening resource limits.

The [first-release goals](specs/first_release_completion_goals.md),
[IVM goals](specs/kotodama_ivm_completion.md) and [ZK goals](specs/zk_first_release_goals.md)
coordinate this work. Remove retired interfaces directly; production behavior
remains deterministic and configuration-owned, with mandatory protocol semantics.

## Architecture and build

The [architecture plan](specs/first_release_architecture_redesign.md),
[repository map](docs/repository_map.md), [SDK inventory](docs/sdk_inventory.md)
and [schema contract](specs/norito_schema_identity.md) define the boundaries.

| ID | Outcome | Owner | Completion criteria |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A1 | Physical model boundaries | Model/Norito/schema | Extract remaining foundational/privacy/service owners with acyclic dependencies; qualify mandatory JSON, declared identities, exact frames and default-stack State coverage. |
| A2 | SDK/service separation | SDK/storage/Musubi | Remove service-runtime edges and standalone CLI duplication; one journal/clock/publication owner and typed storage adapter with shipping dependency gates and CLI packaging. |
| A3 | Async client closure | Rust SDK/callers | Complete capabilities, structured errors, streams and consumer migration; four-validator isolated contexts, cancellation, bounds and acceptance/finality qualification. |
| A4 | Core/Torii cohesion | State/storage/routes | Separate restore, merge, execution and caches while preserving atomic overlay/rollback; capability-owned routes without facade-only layers. |
| A5 | Compiler/resource budgets | Build/component owners | Complete [compile-bloat goals](specs/compile_bloat_optimization_goals.md); requalify test/daemon baselines and introduced units. Meet per-unit limits, 25% model reduction and 13-GiB release ceiling on pinned supported Mac/Linux hosts. |
| A6 | CI/generated ownership | CI/generators/SDKs | Execute affected/full selection, distinct message-control builds and network corridors with correct aggregation; one drift-checked Norito fixture producer and complete generated inventory. |
| A7 | One Kotlin/JVM SDK | Kotlin/Android/Java consumers | Migrate capability/fixture/native/publication gaps before deleting duplicates; preserve assertions, JDK 8 guard, Java-callable APIs, no reflection and Android isolation. |
| A8 | Current documentation | Component/docs owners | Concise status/outcomes, accurate source-coupled specs and working links; public guides in optional `iroha-docs`, with no mandatory development diary. |

## Ledger, consensus and configuration

Authoritative contracts: [Sumeragi](specs/sumeragi.md),
[S1–S9](specs/sumeragi_goals.md), [lanes](specs/sumeragi_lanes.md) and
[evidence API](specs/sumeragi_evidence_api.md).

| ID | Outcome | Owner | Completion criteria |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| N0 | Complete Sumeragi | Core/P2P/Kura | S1–S9: execute-before-vote, round overlay, signed RS16 acquisition, DS-local finality, AMX and evidence/committee scheduling; named mutation test per rule. |
| N1 | Driver/storage closure | Driver/State/Kura/daemon | Sole driver passes conformance oracles, certified execution and retained custody; per-key safety records and remaining retired storage/SDK owner removal. |
| N2 | Consensus qualification | Simulator/CI/operators | Nightly fault scenarios at 10,000 seeds and every mutation killed; native authority and fresh Taira four-validator readiness/write/restart. Governance owns deployment policy. |
| N3 | Dataspace topology/SNS | Nexus/Core/deployment | Manifest-owned membership/privacy/DA/governance; additive activation preserves certified history and cold replay; prove physical server/storage isolation. |
| N4 | Bounded execution/query | State/triggers/query | Consensus-owned budgets, reverse permission index and one registry; deterministic benchmarks, rollback/restart and no production invariant-bypass mutators. |
| N5 | Accounts/fees/transactions | Model/executors/SDKs | Remove inert/redundant carriers; one executable/signing registry. Qualify Hijiri fees, 120,960-block delay, exact quotes and native transactions under stale/private/loss cases. |
| N6 | Authenticated recovery | Kura/startup | Emergency Fast read-only; Strict restores writes. Bound authentication without premature body/snapshot/World decode; positive-height replay and canonical export. |
| N7 | Identity/obligations | Nexus/Torii/Connect | Exact chain/genesis/network binding, snapshot pagination, authenticated renewals/tombstones, audited irreversible AXT retirement and per-issuer quotas. |
| N8 | Configuration closure | Config/runtime | Complete [C5/P2/P8 controls](specs/configuration_simplification.md), generators, aggregated errors and four-daemon paid DPN; qualify the BPNG local preset through contracts, fee authority and application provisioning; one default source without aliases, silent clamps or production environment controls. |
| N9 | Observable durable runtime | Telemetry/logger/Torii | Metric reachability, exporter isolation and immutable classified status; exact retries under crash/disk-full/half-close/permission and cancellation/timeout races. |
| N10 | Current fixtures | Governance/integration | Full feature matrix for catalog/genesis/history, compiler/Kura and callback repairs, preserving real finality and adversarial assertions. |
| N11 | Private settlement | Core/Nexus/native proofs | [Canonical settlement](specs/private_settlement.md), exact authority/publication/recovery and bounded proofs; ten fresh N=3 successes, five-second end-to-end target, N=2/3/4/8/16 faults and aligned leakage/resource campaigns; formal/independent release review. |
| N12 | Production lanes/AMX | Lanes/Queue/Kura/SDKs | Per-instance authority/records and O9 isolation, elastic scale/restart, SDK/OpenAPI and real-peer load; DS-local State and S6 prepare/escrow/decision/settle. |

Original-pool funding must cover retained inputs, projections, proof graphs and
scratch. State/World/membership/journal authority must survive partial publication,
recovery and reclamation. Qualify silent authors, saturation, authenticated
loss/replay, all-seat restart and final-transaction progress on one four/seven-peer
candidate. Geometry changes cannot silently remove or replace live lanes.

[Staking](specs/staking_validator_completion.md) requires real-XOR eligibility and
consent, immutable mint-key generations, E+2 elections, a full E+1 preparation
interval, per-seat beacon custody and atomic activation. Close paid 4→7→4,
rewards/exits/slashing/withdrawals and distinct-fee-asset bounds, then DA/liveness,
formal, SDK and workspace gates.

## SDK, native and physical delivery

See the [JVM inventory](specs/jvm_consolidation_inventory.md),
[native release contract](docs/norito_bridge_release.md),
[KAGEMUSHA design and goals](specs/kagemusha_single_design_proposal.md#10-goals-and-execution-order)

| S10 | Private-file/ZK-ACE SDK | JS/privacy/native | Governed two-pass intent signing, nonserializable private witnesses/erasure; Windows secure storage and authenticated native packages. |
| S11 | Petal Stream devices | Petal/SDKs/device providers | [Device protocol](specs/petal_stream.md#8-qualification): 20 timed runs per device and distance on governed profiles including a low-end 480p–720p Android phone, a modern iPhone and a webcam; `ScanStats` lane rates filed per device with exposure compensation at 0, −1 and −2 EV, and the Swift/Kotlin/JS/Python/C# readers re-run against the same recorded camera captures. Field results tune the inferred-corner search and the 500 ms tracking window, and measure tracking on hand-held phones. |
| S12 | Collection queries | Torii/SDKs/CLI/MCP | One [query language](specs/torii/collection_queries.md) serves the ten collections; complete exact cross-route aggregates and totals over disjoint route partitions, give transaction history an authenticated per-height read path so pages deeper than one scan budget below the tip stay reachable, move the explorer, account-history and contract-activity feeds and the trigger routes onto the contract, and qualify multi-dataspace paging and every SDK suite on live peers. |

Taira qualification preserves signed genesis, native control keys, source/artifact
identity, aggregate deadlines, funding and ambiguous-submit recovery. Require
all-four StateApplied and anchored inclusion; retained-ledger recovery is separate
from fresh genesis. Follow the [reset runbook](specs/runbooks/sumeragi_taira_reset.md)
and [current incident](docs/incidents/2026-09-30-taira-readiness.md), without expired
leases or compatibility decoders. Reuse warm builds/Apple ld locally; qualify
immutable Linux preparation/runtime separately. BPNG infrastructure uses only the
explicitly approved OVH target.

## Candidate sealing and release

| ID | Outcome | Owner | Completion criteria |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| R1 | Clean audited candidate | Release/all owners | [Audit closure](docs/audit_closeout_matrix.md), Core/model identity and SoraCloud replay; locked workspace tests/build, strict applicable lint/features, format, wire/ABI and SDK/native matrices; [authenticated reproducible release](specs/release_runbook.md). |
| R2 | Generated API/approvals | Generators/operators | Clean double generation, synchronized manifests/inventory, signed OpenAPI and exact candidate-bound approvals; docs grant no live mutation authority. |
| R3 | Community ownership | Maintainers/public docs | Clear onboarding, repeat subsystem reviewers and official demos/Q&A/recaps; accurate implementation updates and independent release evidence. |

Ordinary signing permits authenticated software custody with runtime-only secrets,
rotation/revocation and recovery. The first production KAGEMUSHA app profile
uses platform enrollment, hardware-backed keys, genuine monetary proofs and
durable software state/replay authority on a stock uncompromised OS. KAGEMUSHA
verification records do not gate integration or use. Ordinary keys confer no
hardware journal or clock guarantee. IVM is the sole VM; Wasm/WASI is prohibited. Sumeragi requires exact
`3f + 1` global committees, exactly `n - f` votes and signed RS16 availability.
Idle chains create no blocks.

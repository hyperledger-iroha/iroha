## Architecture

Three published SDK modules and a separate JVM `tools` application (`iroha_kotlin_sdk`) serve Kotlin and Java consumers.

### Module: `core-jvm` (JAR, pure Kotlin/JVM)
All protocol logic — no Android dependencies. HTTP/SSE uses the Kotlin-owned
OkHttp adapter, with scoped client lifetimes and borrowed injected backends.
WebSockets use the injected Kotlin-owned Netty engine with explicit NIO/JDK TLS
resources, bounded complete messages and one upgrade attempt. No engine is
selected through platform discovery or a process-global client:
- **`sdk.norito`** — Norito binary codec (TypeAdapter, NoritoCodec, NoritoEncoder/Decoder, compression)
- **`sdk.core.model`** — transaction models, 84 instruction types, InstructionBox, Executable (sealed class)
- **`sdk.crypto`** — Blake2b/2s/3, Ed25519, IrohaHash, and Argon2id key export (JCA + direct BouncyCastle dependency)
- **`sdk.gpu`** — one bounded batch acceleration API for both JVM languages, with explicit backend injection/native loading and automatic CPU/GPU operation selection; `cudaHardwareTest` remains an open gate until JNI per-family completion receipts are implemented
- **`sdk.crypto.keystore.attestation`**, **`KeyAttestation`** — Android-free evidence records, certificate verification and governed revocation policy shared with Android clients and offline JVM tooling
- **`sdk.address`** — account/asset address encoding (IH58, Bech32M)
- **`sdk.tx`** — transaction building, signing, offline envelopes, norito adapters
- **`sdk.client`** — Torii HTTP/WS/SSE client, JSON, transport, queue
- **`sdk.offline`** — aggregate-balance KAGEMUSHA V1 models, canonical
  `kgm1:` peer transports, and hardware lifecycle binding contracts
- **`sdk.connect`** — connect protocol (BouncyCastle)
- **`sdk.telemetry`** — telemetry sink, options, providers
- **`sdk.multisig`**, **`sdk.subscriptions`**, **`sdk.sorafs`**, **`sdk.nexus`** — feature packages

### Module: `client-android` (AAR, depends on `core-jvm`)
Android-specific additions:
- **`sdk.crypto.keystore`** — Android Keystore provisioning, provider dispatch and platform integration; pure evidence verification belongs to `core-jvm`
- **`sdk.telemetry`** — AndroidDeviceProfileProvider, AndroidNetworkContextProvider
- **`sdk.IrohaKeyManager`** — key provider orchestrator

### Module: `kagemusha-wallet-android` (AAR)
KAGEMUSHA wallet orchestration and Android/JNI device lifecycle integration live here.
Keep pure wire and cryptographic contracts in `core-jvm` and general Android client integration
in `client-android`. Device qualification remains separate from JVM/native unit tests.

### Module: `tools` (JVM application)

`iroha-attestation` verifies collected evidence through the `core-jvm` verifier.
It owns command parsing, bounded certificate/ZIP input and atomic JSON output.
It has no Android dependency or Maven SDK publication. Trust roots, expected
challenge/SPKI, governed snapshot commitment and evaluation time are supplied
independently of the evidence bundle. Run `:tools:test :tools:installDist`.

## JDK Compatibility

All modules enforce **JDK 8 API compatibility at compile time** via `-Xjdk-release=8` in `freeCompilerArgs`. The compiler uses JDK 21 (`jvmToolchain(21)`) but restricts the available API surface to JDK 8. Using any JDK 9+ API (e.g. `Optional.isEmpty()`, `BigInteger.TWO`, `URLEncoder.encode(String, Charset)`, `Arrays.compareUnsigned()`) will cause a compilation error. Use Kotlin stdlib equivalents or JDK 8 overloads instead.

**Do not remove `-Xjdk-release=8` from any module's `freeCompilerArgs`.** This flag is the only compile-time guard against JDK 9+ API usage. Without it, incompatible calls compile silently and crash at runtime on Android.

## API Design Rules

### No data classes in public API
**Never use `data class` for public library API types.** Use regular immutable classes with explicit construction invariants, defensive copying and intentional `equals`/`hashCode` semantics. Avoid automatic copying or rendering of sensitive protocol state. This is the first release: remove superseded interfaces and migrate callers without compatibility aliases or wrappers.

### No Reflection
**Never use `java.lang.reflect.*` in this SDK.** This library is consumed by Android apps that use R8/D8 shrinking. Reflection forces consumers to add keep rules for every reflected class/method, complicating ProGuard/R8 configuration. Use unchecked casts, explicit type checks, or Kotlin type system features instead.

### Defensive Copying
All mutable collections and byte arrays are copied on construction and access. Use `toList()`, `toMap()`, `copyOf()` patterns.

### Java Interop
- `@JvmStatic` on companion object factory methods
- `@JvmField` on public properties where Java callers need field-style access
- No `Optional` in Kotlin API — use nullable types (`T?`)
- Authenticated Torii operations use `RequestSigner`; private keys stay with the application or its explicit software signer.

## Key Patterns
- **Two instruction representations**: typed (structured fields) vs wire (opaque `ByteArray` + wire name); `InstructionBox` unifies both
- **Source layout**: main sources under `src/main/java/` (Kotlin files, retained path from Java migration), tests under `src/test/kotlin/`
- **Native libraries**: `.so` files built from Rust via
  `./gradlew :client-android:buildNativeLibs`, not tracked in git. Raw cargo-ndk
  output is isolated below
  `$MOBILE_SDK_ANDROID_ARTIFACT_DIR/gradle-build/iroha_kotlin_sdk/client-android/native/cargo-ndk/<mode>/`;
  compiler state is separately isolated in the sibling
  `native/cargo-target/<mode>/` via `CARGO_TARGET_DIR`; canonically stripped
  authoritative bytes and provenance live in the sibling `generated/` tree.
  Cargo-ndk output first lands in a
  transient per-ABI staging directory so unrelated workspace `cdylib` outputs
  cannot enter the exact raw inventory. The build verifies its race-stable
  Android source seal after every ABI and immediately before and after each raw
  or stripped/provenance promotion, and binds the dependency-closure fingerprint
  into provenance. AGP packages those generated outputs and explicitly excludes
  `src/main/jniLibs`. Every ABI uses canonical Rust 1.93.1 `cargo`, `rustc`, and
  `rustdoc`, plus `CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=1`, `CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0`,
  and `CARGO_NET_OFFLINE=true`. Stock Cargo receives
  `--locked --offline --jobs 1 --manifest-path <canonical-iroha-root>/Cargo.toml`
  and consumes the authenticated repository-root `Cargo.lock`. Bootstrap,
  alternate locks, and compiler or profile configuration overrides are rejected;
  the root lock and effective Cargo configuration are rechecked after execution.
- **ARMv7 diagnostic**: from `kotlin`, use the existing owner-only local artifact
  root, set `MOBILE_SDK_PYTHON_BINARY` to the canonical executable of Python 3.12
  (symbolic links are rejected), and run
  `MOBILE_SDK_ANDROID_ARTIFACT_DIR=/Users/takemiyamakoto/dev/iroha/dist/norito-bridge-android-local ./gradlew :client-android:compileArmv7Diagnostic -PirohaAndroidLocalIntegration=true --console=plain`.
  This task uses the same pinned Rust, NDK, Python, locked offline Cargo and
  source-seal gates, with one `armv7-linux-androideabi` target and the fixed
  `privacy-production-enabled` feature. It preserves the warm
  `native/cargo-target/armv7-diagnostic/` lane and writes raw ELF32 bytes plus
  `native/armv7-diagnostic/diagnostic-manifest.json` under that root's SDK module
  build directory. The report records ARM machine 40, actual native exports and
  LOAD alignment; it grants neither release admission nor KAGEMUSHA device
  qualification. The task supplies no generated JNI or AAR outputs and leaves
  the admitted `arm64-v8a`/`x86_64` inventory unchanged. Configure the pinned
  toolchain and install its ARMv7 standard library before compiling. Run
  `:client-android:verifyArmv7DiagnosticContract` to check routing without a
  native build.

## Testing

JUnit 5 with `@ParameterizedTest` / `@MethodSource` for data-driven tests. Test companion objects provide argument lists via `@JvmStatic` methods.

The separate `:client-android:testDebugHostNative` task requires an explicitly
rebuilt host bridge in one absolute `IROHA_NATIVE_LIBRARY_PATH` directory.
It runs the tagged Java software-key-manager and explicit-chain-context cases,
plus the shared SoraFS reference-validator cases. Missing native artifacts or
capabilities fail; host JNI execution is separate from Android/device qualification.

The current wallet module declares managed platform, payment-key and backup-rule
unit tests. Its Rust `KagemushaWalletPlatformV1` JNI adapter and provider-open call
remain TODO; there is no wallet host-JNI test task or native execution claim.

 * (four rotations, optionally mirrored), ranks the hypotheses by their ring
 * gates plus the `天` silhouette, then reads the dots and tiles. Every tile is
 * classified *jointly*: the 8×8 sample patch is compared against the 32
 * hypotheses (polarity × glyph) and the best match wins, so the katakana and
 * the light/dark bit help each other. Cells the decoder is unsure about become
 * Reed–Solomon erasures.
 *
 * After a frame decodes, [track] reads the next ones from its pose without the
 * finder search (what [PetalScanSession] does within 500 ms).
 *
 * The tile *level read* judges every patch against the light and dark levels
 * measured at the finders. When it leaves lane `P` or `K` unreadable, the
 * *normalised read* is tried: it rescales each patch (and each template) by
 * its own contrast, so over-exposure, veiling light, glare, shadows and
 * gradients cancel out. Only a lane that the level read could not decode is
 * taken from the normalised read, so a frame the level read handles costs
 * nothing extra.
 *
 * All functions are thread-safe. [PetalScanSession] reuses scratch buffers
 * between frames; direct calls allocate their own.

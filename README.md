Iroha is a straightforward distributed ledger technology (DLT), inspired by Japanese Kaizen principle â€” eliminate excessiveness (muri). Iroha has essential functionality for your asset, information and identity management needs, at the same time being an efficient and trustworthy crash fault-tolerant tool for your enterprise needs.

### Features

Iroha has the following features:

* Creation and management of custom fungible assets, such as currencies, kilos of gold, etc.
* Management of user accounts
* Taxonomy of accounts based on domains in the system
* The system of rights and verification of user permissions for the execution of transactions and queries in the system

## Usage

### Requirements

* [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started)
* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
* [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### Start Peers

```bash
cargo build
docker-compose up
```

More details about different ways to use Iroha application can be found [here](https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/blob/iroha2-dev/iroha/README.md#usage).

### Use Client CLI
With the `docker-compose` instance running,

```bash
cp client/config.json target/debug/
cd target/debug
./iroha_client_cli --help
```

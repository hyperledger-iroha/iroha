//! This module contains the domain-specific language (DSL) for constructing queries.
//!
//! # Prototypes and Projections
//!
//! Each data type that can be returned from a query (including nested types) has corresponding prototype and projection types.
//!
//! ## Purpose
//!
//! Prototypes exist to allow constructing queries with a type-safe API.
//! They do not get encoded in the query, existing only for the DSL purposes.
//! They are zero-sized objects that mimic the actual data model types by having the same files as them.
//! They allow constructing query predicates and selectors with a type-safe API.
//!
//! Projections are used as part of the representation of predicates and selectors.
//! Projections by themselves are used to select a subfield of the data model type (possibly deeply nested).
//!
//! ## Usage of prototypes
//!
//! The end-user of iroha gets exposed to prototypes when constructing query predicates and selectors.
//!
//! For both of these, they have to provide a function that takes a prototype and returns something representing the predicates or selector they want to construct.
//!
//! For predicates, they have to return the [`CompoundPredicate`] type, which is by itself a predicate.
//!
//! To get this [`CompoundPredicate`] they have to call one of the helper methods on any of the prototypes they've got access to.
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use iroha_data_model::{domain::DomainId, account::AccountId, query::dsl::CompoundPredicate};
//! let filter_by_domain_name = CompoundPredicate::<AccountId>::build(|account_id| account_id.domain.name.eq("wonderland"));
//! ```
//! For selectors, they have to return a type implementing the [`IntoSelectorTuple`] trait.
//!
//! It can be either a standalone prototype or a tuple of prototypes.
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use iroha_data_model::{domain::DomainId, account::AccountId, query::dsl::SelectorTuple};
//! let select_domain_name = SelectorTuple::<AccountId>::build(|account_id| account_id.domain.name);
//! let select_domain_name_and_signatory =
//!     SelectorTuple::<AccountId>::build(|account_id| (account_id.domain.name, account_id.signatory));
//! ```
//!
//! ## Implementation details
//!
//! Projections types are shared between the filters and selectors by using the [`Projectable`] trait and its marker parameter.
//! For predicates the marker parameter is [`PredicateMarker`], for selectors it is [`SelectorMarker`].
//!
//! All projections have an `Atom` variant, representing the end of field traversal.
//! They also have variants for each field of the data model type, containing a projection for that field type inside.
//!
//! What is stored in the `Atom` variant is decided by the [`Projectable`] trait implementation for the type.
//!
//! # Object projectors
//!
//! To facilitate conversion of prototypes into actual predicates and selectors, there also exist object projectors implementing the [`ObjectProjector`] trait.
//!
//! They get passed as a type parameter to the prototype and describe the path over the type hierarchy that this particular prototype comes from.
//! An object projector accepts a projection or a selector of a more specific type and returns a projection or a selector of a more general type wrapped in a projection.
//!
//! For example, [`type_descriptions::AccountIdDomainProjector`] accepts a predicate or a selector on [`DomainId`](crate::domain::DomainId) and returns a predicate or a selector on [`AccountId`](crate::account::AccountId) by wrapping it with [`type_descriptions::AccountIdProjection`].
//! Notice the difference between projector and projection: projector is just zero-sized utility type, while projection is actually a predicate or a selector.
//!
//! A special kind of projector is a [`BaseProjector`]: it does not change the type of the projection, it just returns it as is.
//! It used to terminate the recursion in the projector hierarchy.
//!
//! # Compound predicates and selectors
//!
//! Normally a predicate has just a single condition on a single field.
//! [`CompoundPredicate`] allows composition of multiple predicates using logical operators.
//! This is the type that is actually sent when a query is requested.
//!
//! A selector also selects just a single field. To allow selecting multiple fields, [`SelectorTuple`] is used in queries.

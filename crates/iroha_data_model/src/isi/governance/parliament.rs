//! Canonical instruction surface for attempt-based SORA Parliament governance.
//!
//! The two instructions in this module deliberately separate immutable proposal
//! admission from reducer transitions.  Core derives block-local heights and
//! verifies authority, world-state bindings, sortition proofs, timed-OVN proofs,
//! and threshold-beacon material before applying a transition.  Consequently,
//! callers cannot supply an execution height through this wire surface.

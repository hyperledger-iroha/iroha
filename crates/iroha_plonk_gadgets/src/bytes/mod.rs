//! Byte linking: byte strings as constrained cells, the `P_bytes` packing of
//! the KAGEMUSHA wallet (spec section 3, wire section 3.2), 32-byte proof
//! messages linked to the field elements a verifier consumes, and the
//! length-prefixed proof export a step leaf hands to the aggregator (M3 gadget
//! `::bytes` of `specs/kagemusha_lambda_omega_v1.md`).
//!
//! # `P_bytes`
//!
//! `P_bytes(d, b) = P(d, [len(b)] || c_0 || ... || c_(m-1))` with
//! `m = ceil(len(b) / 31)`, where `c_i` is bytes `31 i .. 31 i + 30` of `b`
//! read as a little-endian integer and the last chunk is zero-filled
//! (`kagemusha_wallet_packed_bytes_v1` of `iroha_data_model`). Every chunk is
//! below `2^248 < p`, so the packing is injective for a fixed length, and the
//! length element separates lengths. [`p_bytes_items_native`] and
//! [`p_bytes_native`] are the native references; [`PBytes`] builds the same
//! element list in circuit and hashes it with a [`crate::SpongeChip`].
//!
//! # The tape ([`tape`])
//!
//! A run of witness bytes takes one row per byte on two equality-enabled
//! advice columns. The primary column holds little-endian running sums over
//! segments of at most 31 bytes (`z_j = b_j + 256 z_(j+1)`, the last byte of a
//! segment is `z` itself), and every byte expression is looked up in a
//! 256-row byte table, so each segment word is the little-endian integer of
//! its bytes. The secondary column recomposes the same bytes along a second,
//! independent segmentation, little- or big-endian, and a gate equates its
//! byte expression with the primary one on every row it covers. The cost is
//! one cell per byte for a run that is only packed, and two cells per byte
//! for a run whose bytes are also linked to other values.
//!
//! Primary segments follow the 31-byte chunk boundaries of the `P_bytes`
//! string the run belongs to ([`chunk_segments`]), so a chunk is a segment
//! word, or a glue combination of segment words and constant bytes when a
//! chunk mixes them; no chunk needs a range check of its own.
//!
//! # Packing ([`packing`])
//!
//! [`PBytes`] places constant bytes, tape runs and bounded words
//! ([`BoundedBytes`]: a word known to be below `256^len`, such as an opaque
//! chunk range-checked by the running-sum chip, or an exported chunk received
//! as a bounded instance) at their offsets of a `P_bytes` string, splits a
//! bounded word that crosses a chunk boundary ([`split_bounded`]) and
//! produces the chunk words and the digest. Constant bytes inside a signed
//! transcript (enum tags, zero fill, the SEC1 tag `0x04` before a P-256
//! key) are constant pieces between tape runs, so they cost no cells.
//!
//! The length-prefixed export ([`export_length_prefixed`]) is the proof
//! string `LE32 len(sigma) || sigma` of the step-proof digest cut into chunk
//! pieces: a step leaf (over `Fq`) exports these words as bounded instances,
//! and the aggregator (over `Fp`) appends them to its own `P_bytes` strings,
//! the sigma-only `proof_digest` (aligned, no rows) or `LE32 len(Omega) ||
//! Omega || LE32 len(sigma) || sigma` (realigned with one split per piece).
//! For the measured sigma of 3,296 bytes the export has
//! [`SIGMA_EXPORT_CHUNKS`] = 107 pieces.
//!
//! # Messages ([`element`])
//!
//! A 32-byte little-endian proof message (PIPA-v1 section 1) is decoded from
//! secondary segments `[16, 15, 1]` into `lo < 2^128`, `hi < 2^127` and the top
//! bit. A compressed Pasta point is `x` with the parity of `y` in bit 255: the
//! link checks that `x = lo + 2^128 hi` is canonical and that the canonical
//! parity of `y` is the top bit, so the opposite point and the alias `y + p`
//! are rejected. A point over the other Pasta field (the Vesta accumulator
//! point in the `Fp` aggregator) links with `y` given as canonical limbs. A
//! scalar must have a clear top bit and `lo + 2^128 hi` below its modulus.
//! Every link has a hard form (unsatisfiable on a mismatch) and a soft form
//! (a bit, never unsatisfiable, determined by the bytes) for soft verifiers.
//! Big-endian
//! 32-byte values (P-256 coordinates and signature halves in the signed
//! transcripts) decode from secondary segments `[16, 16]` into two `U128`
//! halves.
//!
//! # Scope
//!
//! Byte strings have lengths fixed by the circuit (a verifying key fixes the
//! proof length, a variant fixes every transcript layout), so the length
//! element is a constant. The point link does not check that `(x, y)` is on
//! the curve; the curve chip does, and that check also excludes the identity
//! `(0, 0)` because `5` is not a square in either Pasta field.
//!
//! TODO(M4 bytes): when the A-leaf layout is fixed, check bytes against a
//! shared 15-bit value column instead of the chip's own 256-row table (a
//! byte `v` as the two memberships `v` and `2^7 v`, as the foreign-field top
//! sublimbs do, `crate::ff`), riding on a host argument of that leaf
//! (`crate::table`), so the chip stops owning its own lookup argument.
//! Sharing the table alone removes no argument; the Q leaf does not use
//! this chip.

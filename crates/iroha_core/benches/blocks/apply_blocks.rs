//! Benchmark fixture for reexecuting and applying certified blocks.
//!
//! A source chain executes and certifies the benchmark blocks once. Each measured replica
//! starts from the same signed genesis and applies that certified suffix the way a node
//! applies blocks Kura already holds: every certificate is verified, every block is stored,
//! re-executed to its certified result and published through the node's `StateExecutor`.

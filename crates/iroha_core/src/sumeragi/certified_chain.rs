//! The certified-chain reader: committed Sumeragi blocks as their Kura frames certify them
//! (`specs/sumeragi.md` §12.7).
//!
//! Kura holds one frame per committed height: the result-bearing iroha block and its
//! [`CommitCertificate`] — the canonical core [`BlockHeader`], the `CommitQC` and the preimage of
//! the certified result `R` ([`ExecutionResultCommitment`]). Genesis carries a result-only
//! certificate (no header, no `CommitQC`). Its signed body and registered authority are the
//! network-pinned trust root. The result-only execution preimage is added after genesis executes;
//! genesis signatures do not authenticate that preimage. An exact-quorum successor authenticates
//! `R_g` through its signed `parent_result`; a genesis-only result requires local deterministic
//! execution trust or a separately authenticated replay anchor.
//!
//! The reader offers three reads with explicit authority sources:
//!
//! - [`committed_block`]: **consensus-visible data only**, authenticated by the
//!   original native execution tip captured in the same State publication generation.
//!   A bounded reverse walk checks native `parent_hash`, `parent_result` and the
//!   Iroha parent hash before interpreting the requested result. The tip is issued
//!   only by the original verified worker (or original signed-genesis execution),
//!   outside World to avoid an R self-reference. Snapshot claims are verified
//!   against an actual certified native prefix before this authority is restored.
//!   Local `CommitQC` bytes are never decoded by this deterministic path: honest
//!   nodes may retain different valid exact quorums for the same header and R.
//!   Hash journals and structural frame decoding alone grant no execution authority.
//! - [`CertifiedChain::certified`]: the committed read **plus the local `CommitQC`**. The
//!   certificate must certify exactly this header and result (kind, height, block hash, result,
//!   instance) and verify under the exact BLS quorum of the committee of its height.
//!   Native finality also requires
//!   the authenticated result, schedule and signed availability; signatures alone are insufficient.
//! - [`CertifiedChain::certified_from_execution`]: the same full certificate checks
//!   anchored through the captured original native execution tip. A bounded reverse
//!   walk authenticates the target and its parent; the parent's executed schedule
//!   supplies the target authority. This State-only read refuses genesis and
//!   unanchored/offline sources. It charges each frame before I/O under one retained
//!   allocation scope, avoiding repeated genesis-prefix decoding for recent queries.
//!
//! **Epoch authority.** Every result retains its complete native epoch and schedule graph.
//! The reader verifies the prefix iteratively from the signed genesis context, checks both
//! parent links and the parent result at every height, and carries a bounded schedule plus
//! active authority. Chain parameters retain lag two; a successor authority is admitted only
//! after the incumbent exact quorum certifies the boundary. Every signature
//! binds the scheduling epoch and complete context identity. The preceding certified pulse
//! supplies fresh leader randomness, even when an authority generation is retained.
//! Missing, reordered or invalid authority fails closed even after that committee has rotated
//! out of World. There is no trust-in-local-storage certificate verdict.
//!
//! **Chains.** [`CertifiedChain::walk`] reads consecutive heights and additionally checks that
//! each block extends the previous one: its core header binds the parent's block hash and `R`,
//! and its iroha header the parent's iroha hash.
//!
//! **Restoration.** `CertifiedChain::from_pinned` runs this same verifier before a State exists,
//! against an explicit network, configured chain instance and exact committed hash cut. It
//! accepts no World authority. Each body is checked against the cut before its prefix is
//! authenticated; the lone-genesis execution trust limitation is unchanged.
//!
//! **Local attempts.** Reader failures separate completed [`ChainReadError`] rejections from
//! non-wire [`ExecutionAttemptError::Deferred`] outcomes. Original decoder refusals are
//! classified before diagnostics erase their surviving caller limits. A partial decoder is
//! dropped; retry uses the same captured State and original source bytes. This does not fund
//! the entire decoded graph or invent an allocation-pool release notification.

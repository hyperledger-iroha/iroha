//! Scheduling of execution, apply and payload building (`specs/sumeragi.md` §12.2, §12.3 O3,
//! O4) over one executor that runs one operation at a time:
//!
//! - every `Execute` is answered exactly once — `Valid`, `Invalid`, `Failed`, or `Cancelled`
//!   when a later `DiscardExecution` of its height left it out (a running job finishes first
//!   and is then answered `Cancelled`), or when its height was applied meanwhile;
//! - the most recent `Execute` runs first; one whose parent post-state the executor does not
//!   hold is *parked* (never `Failed`) until the parent is applied or executed;
//! - `CommitBlock`s apply strictly in height order in three steps — prepare (the cached
//!   post-state or a re-execution; an execution of the block in flight finishes first and is
//!   reused, an `Execute` of it still queued is answered from the apply), durable append to the
//!   block store, commit — and `BlockApplied` carries the applied header; a local commitment
//!   that differs from the certified one is reported as `ApplyDiverged` and apply stops; local
//!   retryable refusals retain the original owner and await its release when supplied;
//!   source-less failures back off, and consuming failures halt;
//! - once prepared, and while a failed step waits, a commit runs alone: no other executor
//!   call comes between its prepare and its commit (the executor may hold a single live
//!   overlay); a failed commit is retried after a fresh prepare, without a second append or
//!   resetting its failure backoff;
//! - `BuildPayload` for height `h` runs only after `h − 1` is applied (the builder filters the
//!   applied transactions), and `PayloadReady{req}` follows at most once an `EMPTY` answer;
//! - the queues other than the `Execute`s are bounded: discards of one height merge (keeping
//!   what both keep), and rejections are deduplicated and capped (the oldest go first: the
//!   quarantine is best effort).

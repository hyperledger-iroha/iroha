//! Backend traits of the Sumeragi driver (`specs/sumeragi.md` §12.2, §13.5): the transport,
//! the safety-record store with its store id and installation log, the body store, the block
//! store, the clock, the application's executor and an observer of reports.
//!
//! The node implements them over P2P, files, Kura and State; the tests and the §13.5
//! conformance runs use in-memory fakes. Every method either returns at once or blocks only the
//! driver thread that owns the call (persistence, execution, serving), never the event loop.

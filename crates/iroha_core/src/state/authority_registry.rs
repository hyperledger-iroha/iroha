//! Exhaustive classification of persistent State authority and physical owners.
//!
//! Each owner is destructured without `..` by the same declaration that supplies
//! its registry. A new field or changed field type therefore needs an explicit
//! classification before the crate compiles. Schema names come from Norito's
//! declared identities, never Rust paths inferred at runtime.
//!
//! This is an inventory, not a certificate that a derived index has been checked.
//! Existing reconstruction evidence and missing projection/checker obligations
//! remain distinct. In particular config objects, opaque verifier handles and
//! historical cursors cannot silently become node-local policy.
//!
//! The World state accumulator (`world_projection::WorldStateAccumulator`)
//! commits exactly the canonical World fields declared here, and the execution
//! result `R` binds its root. TODO(S9): supply every required semantic
//! projection and derivation validator for the State-level fields and bind
//! recovery to one predecessor. No row disclosure or proof authority is
//! provided here.

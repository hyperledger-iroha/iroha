//! Both images use the same bounded relation as committed capture. Stored map
//! keys and status membership are checked; proof contents, verifier admission,
//! proof tags and historical finality remain with their separate owners.
//! TODO: consume this scoped encoder with every canonical table/cell, original
//! relation and authenticated history in StatePublication. Original predecessor
//! publication checks, complete scratch admission and durable node custody remain
//! required before any complete State root or finalized anchor is exposed.

//! Inventory of every State and World field, the roots each one currently affects and
//! every commitment over State content that exists in the tree.
//!
//! `specs/state_table_inventory.json` is generated here from the source:
//!
//! - the exhaustive authority registry (`STATE_FIELDS`, which destructures `State`,
//!   `WorldData`, the trigger set and the canonical runtime without `..`) and the
//!   exhaustive destructure of `TransactionsStorage`;
//! - the World state accumulator's field index, the production World pass and the exact
//!   table catalog;
//! - a scan of every non-test Rust source of `iroha_core` and `iroha_data_model` (the
//!   drift test of `specs/sumeragi.md` §16.8): it discovers domain literals by their
//!   form, independently of the listed commitments, pins the sources and occurrence
//!   counts of every listed literal, and counts the uses of commitment constructions in
//!   code;
//! - a signature scan of every non-test source of `iroha_core`: the functions and methods
//!   with a State or World receiver or reader argument and a hash-bearing return value
//!   (`state_table_inventory_functions.rs`). A reader is `State`, `World` or the owner of
//!   another registry field with its handles and reader traits, or a table or cell
//!   handle; a method belongs to a reader when the whole header of its `impl` or `trait`
//!   block names one;
//! - the declarations of the consensus-carried types and their nested records: the block
//!   header, the block payload and block result, the signed genesis consensus parameters,
//!   the execution result, every Sumeragi wire message (`crates/iroha_sumeragi`), the lane
//!   result, the peer handshake capabilities (`crates/iroha_p2p`) and the node's network
//!   envelope;
//! - the execution-witness key tags of the data model, the SCCP write-set encoder, the
//!   World accessors of the functions that derive witness values and the fields of the
//!   witness value types.
//!
//! The tracked file is compared byte for byte with a fresh generation, so it fails when
//!
//! - the registry gains, loses or reclassifies a field,
//! - a field starts or stops affecting the certified World state root or an
//!   execution-witness family,
//! - a domain literal appears that is not listed exactly: under a commitment of `ROOTS`,
//!   under an application accumulator, or with its reviewed use in
//!   `state_table_inventory_domains.rs`. No listing matches a prefix, so a new literal
//!   under a known prefix fails as well,
//! - a listed domain literal appears in another source, or a source changes its number
//!   of occurrences: every use of a listed literal is reviewed again,
//! - a source starts to use a Merkle, sparse-Merkle, multiset or accumulator
//!   construction, or an approved source changes its number of uses,
//! - a function that reads State and returns a hash-bearing value appears, moves or is
//!   renamed without an exact listing,
//! - a hash-bearing field, or a nested named type, appears in a listed consensus-carried
//!   type or execution-witness value type without a classification,
//! - any field, whatever its type, appears in a carrier type whose every field is
//!   classified: the block, its payload and its result, the header, `R`, the lane result,
//!   the genesis context parameters, the epoch identity and the handshake capabilities,
//! - a function that derives a witness value reads another World accessor,
//! - an expected-open defect changes (for example a State-level canonical field becomes
//!   committed), or
//! - cited source evidence disappears or is duplicated.
//!
//! What the scan does not do: it detects carrier, signature, literal and construction
//! drift, not arbitrary State dataflow. A digest of State content is not detected when
//! its domain literal does not have the form of `DOMAIN_LITERAL_RULE`, it uses none of
//! the listed constructions, it enters no listed witness value type and no listed
//! consensus-carried type, and no function with a State or World reader in its signature
//! returns it ([`HASH_RETURN_RULE`]). A digest held in a type that the hash rules do not
//! match, for example an integer, is not detected either: such fields are listed by review
//! (`Carrier::reviewed`). The signature scan reads literal `impl` and `trait` blocks, also
//! in macro bodies, and does not expand macros. The commitments that only a review found
//! are listed under [`REVIEW_ONLY_ROOTS`]. Witness values that are State records copied
//! as written are rows; their own fields are not walked.
//!
//! Cited line numbers are locators: they are refreshed by regeneration and not compared,
//! so unrelated edits above a cited line do not fail the check.
//!
//! Regenerate after an intended change with
//! `cargo test -p iroha_core --lib regenerate_state_table_inventory -- --ignored`
//! and review the difference. The tracked file describes the shipping `node` feature set,
//! whose `State` has the `state.telemetry` field.
//!
//! The contract these facts are measured against is `specs/sumeragi.md` §16. The tests
//! below also pin the as-built premises of its §16.5 and §16.6, and they are the evidence
//! for "every table mutation affects the appropriate root": each inventoried field is
//! driven through the production accumulator under its registry identity, and the result
//! must agree with the inventory.

//! Deterministic, fail-closed reducer for one SORA Parliament governance attempt.
//!
//! The reducer owns the consensus-relevant lifecycle links between an immutable
//! proposal, future-beacon sortition, sealed body instances, private OVN ballot
//! attempts, certification, and enactment.  Cryptographic verification happens
//! before a transition is submitted; this module makes the verified bindings
//! immutable and rejects replay, stage skipping, and cross-attempt substitution.
//!
//! There is deliberately no plaintext ballot or manual-opening transition.  A
//! missed phase deadline or objectively absent finalized release pulse produces
//! `NoResult`; retry requires a fresh ballot attempt and a fresh TLE session.
//! Every fresh roster/pulse generation and every replacement timed-OVN session
//! spends one proposal-wide redraw unit. Exact transport retransmission retains
//! its committed randomness and therefore cannot spend another unit.

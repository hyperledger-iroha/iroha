//! Shared wallet control around the stock-phone `Advance` custody authority.
//!
//! Frozen G1 inputs are durable before Advance. Only its retained completion authorizes a
//! completed operation; an archive, checkpoint or proof never does. Reconciliation follows
//! the provider-selected capsule chain and indexes permanent credit identities. Folding
//! consumes that chain in order, persists every sub-proof, self-verifies Ω including both
//! curve decides through [`NativeProofs`], and records exactly one Ω per head.
//!
//! The native transition/recursive relation implementation is an injected, mandatory
//! dependency. This module does not substitute a structural G1 check for a proof verifier.
//! SDKs should own I/O and call this shared state machine rather than reproduce its rules.
//!
//! Archive storage must share the provider's non-backup custody root and exclusive lifetime.
//! [`ProviderArchive`] and [`AdvanceHandle`] share one exclusive provider. Every archive call
//! uses its protected-data bracket; fixed manifests bind index roots in source-selected
//! metadata generations and the existing iOS rollback anchor. [`FsArchive`] is a low-level
//! standalone store for tests/diagnostics and does not itself provide those brackets.
//! No archive record grants monetary authority independently of Advance.
//!
//! Collection records a source-selected intent before deleting historical witness objects.
//! A newer verified Ω supplies coverage; Send additionally needs pending-map nonmembership.
//! Earned-fee Payments have separate custody until their exact finalized payout is verified.
// TODO(G3/G4): qualify the installed full-catalog native owner through wallet/SDK delivery and
// the complete custody/proof lifetime on stock phones. Run relations remain artifact-dependent.
// Persistent replay metadata and unreachable immutable index nodes remain retained; a future
// compactor must preserve source-selected reachable roots without full-history hot-path scans.

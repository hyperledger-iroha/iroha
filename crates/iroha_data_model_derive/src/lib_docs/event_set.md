Create an event set structure from an event enum.

Event set is a set of multiple event types, allowing to efficiently test whether an event is in a set.

For this event enum:

```rust
# use iroha_data_model_derive::EventSet;
#[derive(EventSet)]
pub enum TestEvent {
    Event1,
    Event2,
    NestedEvent(AnotherEvent),
}
pub struct AnotherEvent;
```

The macro will generate a `TestEventSet` struct.

It will have associated constants that correspond to a singleton set for each event that can be accessed like `TestEventSet::Event1`.

The sets can be combined either with a `|` operator or with the `or` method to match multiple events at once: `TestEventSet::Event1 | TestEventSet::Event2`.

Variants that:
1. have a single unnamed field
2. have the type name end with `Event`

are treated as nested events and their set constant has `Any` prepended to the name. For example, `TestEventSet::AnyNestedEvent`.

The set has the following methods:
```ignore
impl TestEventSet {
    /// Returns a set that doesn't contain any events
    const fn empty() -> TestEventSet;
    /// Returns a set that contains all events
    const fn all() -> TestEventSet;
    /// Computes union of two sets, const form of the `|` operator
    const fn or(self, other: TestEventSet) -> TestEventSet;
    /// Checks if the set contains a specific event
    const fn matches(&self, event: &TestEvent) -> bool;
}
```

Implemented traits:
```ignore
#[derive(
    Copy,
    Clone,
    PartialEq,
    Eq,
    PartialOrd,
    Ord,
    Hash,
    norito::codec::Decode,
    norito::codec::Encode,
    iroha_schema::IntoSchema,
)]

/// Prints the list of events in the set
///
/// For example: `TestEventSet[Event1, AnyNestedEvent]`
impl core::fmt::Debug;

/// Union of two sets
impl core::ops::BitOr;
```

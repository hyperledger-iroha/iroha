//! The Sumeragi state machine (spec §6–§10, §12): [`Core`], one per consensus instance.
//!
//! [`Core::handle`] runs one handler to completion and returns the driver's actions in order;
//! [`Core::next_wakeup`] is the earliest pending deadline. The handlers are split by concern:
//!
//! - `intake`: the intake filter of §6.1, `Status` handling (§6.11), the probe echo (§7.4 R2)
//!   and the proposal request (`request_proposal`);
//! - `proposal`: accepting proposals (§6.2), execution results (§6.3) and the Prepare vote;
//! - `votes`: vote pools, aggregation, `PrepareQC`s (`on_qc`), the Commit vote and the stage
//!   ladder (§5.2, §6.4, §6.5);
//! - `timeout`: timing out, joining, timeout certificates and view changes (§6.6, §6.7, §6.12);
//! - `round`: commit, height entry, `BlockApplied`, the safety monitor (§6.8, §6.13, §7.6);
//! - `sync`: catch-up, body wants and serving (§6.9);
//! - `propose`: work-driven proposing (§6.10);
//! - `timers`: `Tick`, retransmission, rebroadcast, `Status` cadence and the probe (§6.11);
//! - `restart`: `Core::new` and `restore`, the restart rules R1–R6 (§7.4).
//!
//! Safety-relevant ordering: every signed message is created after the `PersistSafety` that
//! records it, in the same action list (§7.4, O2), and the node's own votes and timeouts enter
//! its own pools last through `pool_insert` / `timeout_insert`, because forming a certificate
//! may commit and move to the next height.

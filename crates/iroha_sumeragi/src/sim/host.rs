//! The host seam of the simulator (spec §13.5): the node program the world runs for each
//! replica, behind the [`Host`] trait.
//!
//! A host owns what a production driver owns between the hardware and the core: the ingress
//! queues with the O5 priorities and the O6/O8 bounds and classes, the consensus core itself,
//! and the O1/O2 persist-before-effect barrier. The world keeps everything else as fake
//! backends — network, clocks, the write device and record store with the installation log,
//! the body store, the block store with O3 apply, the O4 executor, the payload builder — and
//! assembles the `Init` of every (re)start from the durable stores.
//!
//! The default host, [`FakeHost`], is the simulator's fake driver. An external node
//! implementation (the production driver of `iroha_core`, run against the world as its
//! hardware) is another [`Host`], chosen per replica by [`Scenario::host`](super::Scenario).
//! Byzantine machines always run the fake driver: their strategies rewrite its actions.
//!
//! **Hosts that own their driver scheduling.** A host whose [`Host::owns_io`] is `true` also
//! schedules its own persistence (one ordered write queue with retries), execution (parking,
//! most-recent-first, exactly one answer per `Execute`), apply (`CommitBlock` in order, reusing
//! an execution in flight) and payload building. The world then no longer interprets the core's
//! actions (the oracles still observe them): it performs only the host's device operations
//! ([`Op`]) on the replica's fake backends — the write device (whose writes may fail, F27, and
//! are lost in a crash), the executor with its post-state cache, the block store, the builder,
//! the network and serving — and reports their completions ([`Done`]) back. `Init` assembly and
//! serving stay with the world.

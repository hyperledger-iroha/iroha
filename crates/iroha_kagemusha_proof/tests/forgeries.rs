//! Consistent-forgery (malicious-witness) tests of the step relations.
//!
//! The per-cell tamper suite changes one cell and keeps every other cell
//! honest, so a free witness that is only copied into a hash looks pinned.
//! These tests instead let the forger choose a value *consistently*: the
//! forged witness goes through the real circuit, which recomputes every
//! copy and every downstream digest. Each test then asks the question a
//! verifier asks: can the forger make a statement that a consumer accepts
//! (the spec section 3.2 checks of `iroha_kagemusha_proof::consumer`) and
//! that the circuit of the selected verifying key proves?
//!
//! - **Identity** (credential, asset, scheme, wallet): the identity limbs
//!   are opened core cells, so a forged identity changes the predecessor
//!   commitment. A statement that keeps the real head with another identity
//!   is unsatisfiable; the asset, which the lineage proof does not expose,
//!   is caught by the circuit alone.
//! - **Receiver binding** (owner answer Q8): `sigma_recv` matches the
//!   Request's receiver by `wallet_id` inside `credit_id`; a Request quoted
//!   under the credential before a renewal stays receivable, a Request for
//!   another wallet is not.
//! - **Credit identifier**: it is `P(kgwcrdt1, Request body)` in circuit, so
//!   a statement with any other credit is unsatisfiable, and the consumer
//!   recomputes it from the Request.
//! - **Request accounts**: substituting either account digest changes the
//!   credit and statement while keeping the predecessor. The consumer
//!   rejects it for the signed Request, and the circuit cannot prove the
//!   original statement using the substituted account.
//! - **`burned_total`**: the lineage input is checked against the balance
//!   and bound in the statement, so dropping it to free burned value fails
//!   the consumer's comparison with the lineage proof.
//! - **Blacklist age** (owner answer Q5): a stale list is unprovable under
//!   the blacklist relation, and Ω(pred)'s mask selects that relation, so
//!   neither the control-free relation nor a rewritten mask or issue time
//!   escapes it.
//! - **Self-payment**: payer and receiver wallets must differ.
//! - **Accepted time**: the successor's floor is the accepted lower time, so
//!   a later Send cannot accept an earlier time.
//! - **Commitments and relation identity**: the statement's predecessor is
//!   the opened commitment, and the scheme-level relation identity is bound
//!   by the statement digest.

//! Native consumer checks of a step statement (spec section 3.2; the G1
//! `KagemushaWalletStatementV1::validate_against_lineage` and Payment
//! checks): what a package consumer compares before mutation, the relation
//! whose verifying key it then selects, and the public input it verifies the
//! step proof against.
//!
//! A package carries its statement in canonical form ([`StatementV1`]); the
//! step proof's public input is the statement digest. A consumer never takes
//! a field from the statement on trust:
//!
//! - the relation identity must be the scheme's (Ω(pred) exposes it for a
//!   Send);
//! - for `sigma_send`, the predecessor, credential digest, scheme,
//!   lifecycle, enabled-controls mask, `burned_total` and pending-outgoing
//!   root must equal the predecessor's lineage proof Ω(pred)
//!   ([`LineageView`]); the mask selects the verifying key
//!   ([`Accepted::relation`]);
//! - the scheme, asset, wallets, send ordinal, amount and fee must equal the
//!   Request body the consumer holds, and `credit_id` is recomputed from
//!   that body, never read from the statement.
//!
//! A Receive statement is matched to its Request by `credit_id`, whose
//! preimage holds the receiver `wallet_id` that `sigma_recv` equates with
//! the receiver's core wallet. Its credential digest is the receiver's
//! current credential and is never compared with the Request's receiver
//! credential digest (owner answer Q8): a Request quoted before a renewal
//! stays receivable after it. The receiver's `payment_key` is matched by the
//! receipt and credential checks outside this crate (G1
//! `KagemushaWalletPaymentV1::receive_effect`) and by `Λ_recv`.
//!
//! Only then does the consumer verify the proof with the selected key. A
//! statement that claims another credential, wallet, credit or
//! `burned_total` than Ω(pred) and the Request therefore fails here. A
//! statement that passes here but is not what the prover's predecessor
//! opened (for example another asset, which Ω does not expose) fails
//! verification.

# Torii App API: ZK Attachments and Proof Tooling

This document describes the app-facing ZK endpoints exposed by Torii for
storing proof attachments and running proof tooling. These features are
strictly non-consensus and do not affect block production or validation.

Contents
- Endpoints and storage layout
- Configuration (TTL, size caps, tokens, rate limits)
- Operational notes and safety
- Examples (curl and CLI)

## Endpoints

Attachments (store sanitized bytes with metadata):
- `POST /v1/zk/attachments` — store a new attachment (body = bytes, sanitized on ingest)
- `GET  /v1/zk/attachments` — list stored attachments (JSON array)
- `GET  /v1/zk/attachments/count` — count stored attachments
- `GET  /v1/zk/attachments/{id}` — fetch stored attachment bytes by id
- `DELETE /v1/zk/attachments/{id}` — delete an attachment

Every attachment route requires canonical account authentication over the exact
runtime `NetworkId`, HTTP method, URI, nonce, expiry, and bounded raw body. Torii
verifies these headers before query/path/body extraction and derives the storage
tenant only from the verified account. An API token, when configured, is an
additional gate and never establishes attachment ownership.

Confidential-tree witnesses (committed ledger reads):
- `POST   /v1/zk/roots` — return the bounded recent-root window for one asset
- `POST   /v1/zk/merkle-path` — return current inclusion paths and the next zero-leaf path

IVM prove helper (non-consensus proof generation):
- `POST   /v1/zk/ivm/derive` — execute IVM bytecode and derive an `IvmProved` payload (commitments only)
- `POST   /v1/zk/ivm/prove` — submit a prove job for execution-derived `IvmProved` payload (returns `{ job_id }`)
- `GET    /v1/zk/ivm/prove/{job_id}` — poll job status (`pending|running|done|error`)
- `DELETE /v1/zk/ivm/prove/{job_id}` — delete/cancel a job from the in-memory cache

`POST /v1/zk/verify-batch` and `POST /v1/zk/ivm/derive` require canonical
account authentication over the exact runtime `NetworkId`, method, URI, nonce,
expiry, and bounded raw body before content-type inspection or decode. The IVM
derive signer must equal the authority encoded in its body. Proof admission and
blocking-work limits remain additional gates, not authentication substitutes.

Notes
- Attachment id is a deterministic Blake2b‑32 (hex, lowercase) of the sanitized body bytes.
- Content type is normalized from magic‑byte sniffing; the declared header is recorded in `provenance`.
- Attachments persist on disk under `./storage/torii/zk_attachments/`:
  - `./storage/torii/zk_attachments/{tenant-key}/{id}.bin` (body)
  - `./storage/torii/zk_attachments/{tenant-key}/{id}.json` (metadata)
- Background-prover diagnostics persist under
  `./storage/torii/zk_prover/reports/{id}.json`. They are node-local worker
  state and have no public HTTP or SDK surface. Metadata is stored as one
  bounded, atomically replaced summary shard
  per report under `./storage/torii/zk_prover/report_index/{id}.json`; saving a
  report never rewrites a global summary file. A shard is capped at 64 KiB;
  its projected error and content-type fields are capped at 4 KiB and 256
  bytes respectively. Retention and garbage collection scan one shard at a
  time.
- Base directory is configured with `torii.data_dir`; tests/dev harnesses can override with `data_dir::OverrideGuard`.
- IVM derive/prove require bytecode with the IVM ZK mode bit set (`mode & ZK != 0`) and a required typed `fee_payment` intent whose `gas_limit` is set. Obtain the exact intent from `POST /v1/fees/quote`; legacy `fee_sponsor`, `gas_limit`, and `gas_asset_id` metadata keys are rejected.
- `/v1/zk/ivm/derive` accepts verifying keys with backend `halo2/ipa` or `stark/fri` (including `stark/fri/...` variants) (must be compatible with `ivm-execution-v1`).
- `/v1/zk/ivm/prove` accepts `vk_ref.backend` `halo2/ipa` and `stark/fri` (including `stark/fri/...` variants) when the node is built with `zk-stark`.
- STARK verification (`stark/fri` family) is supported when built with feature `zk-stark` and enabled via config (`zk.stark.enabled=true`).
- For `halo2/*` and `stark/fri` backends, proof bytes are expected to be a Norito-encoded `OpenVerifyEnvelope`.
- For STARK wrappers, `OpenVerifyEnvelope.public_inputs` carries schema-descriptor bytes; concrete public input values are carried in `StarkFriOpenProofV1.public_inputs`.
- Confidential-tree reads dispatch exclusively through the tree profile persisted in `ZkAssetState`. The first release admits only `PoseidonPastaV1`; verifier-role bindings and node-local configuration do not select a tree hash or depth. Torii validates every retained root and frontier checkpoint before serving witnesses. A registered tree with no commitments returns the profile-defined depth-16 empty root as both `latest` and the sole root entry.

## Configuration

All runtime behavior is configured via `iroha_config` (Torii section). The following keys are relevant:

- `torii.attachments_ttl_secs` (u64)
  - Time‑to‑live for attachments. A background GC removes entries older than this TTL.
  - Default: 7 days.
- `torii.attachments_max_bytes` (u64)
  - Maximum size (bytes) for both the submitted body and the canonical sanitized body retained for a single attachment. A compressed body that expands beyond this cap is rejected with `413 Payload Too Large` rather than being stored unreadably.
  - Default: 4 MiB.
- `torii.attachments_per_tenant_max_count` (u64)
  - Maximum number of attachments retained per tenant (0 disables the cap). The tenant is the exact canonically authenticated `AccountId`; anonymous and token-derived tenants do not exist.
  - Default: 128.
- `torii.attachments_per_tenant_max_bytes` (u64)
  - Aggregate bytes retained per tenant. When an upload can fit after tenant-local eviction, Torii fsyncs one bounded transaction intent, commits the new body, metadata, and prover reference durably, then removes the oldest attachments for that tenant. Startup and every later mutation roll back an incomplete incoming commit or finish victim deletion after a complete commit. A deletion failure returns `500` and retains the intent for recovery; bodies larger than the cap are rejected with `413`.
  - Default: 64 MiB.
- `torii.attachments_global_max_count` (u64)
  - Maximum number of attachment copies retained by one node across all tenants. The supported range is `1..=20000`, matching the bounded filesystem quota scan.
  - Default: 4096.
- `torii.attachments_global_max_bytes` (u64)
  - Aggregate sanitized attachment bytes retained by one node across all tenants. An upload may evict only the submitting tenant's oldest entries to make room; Torii returns `413` rather than evicting another tenant's data.
  - Default: 1 GiB.
- `torii.attachments_allowed_mime_types` (list of strings)
  - Allowlisted MIME types for attachment payloads after magic‑byte sniffing.
  - Default: `["application/x-norito", "application/json", "application/x-zk1"]`.
- `torii.attachments_max_expanded_bytes` (u64)
  - Maximum bytes the sanitizer may expand while inspecting gzip/zstd payloads. The resulting canonical body must still fit `torii.attachments_max_bytes` before it can be retained.
  - Default: 16 MiB.
- `torii.attachments_max_archive_depth` (u32)
  - Maximum nested gzip/zstd layers.
  - Default: 2.
- `torii.attachments_sanitizer_mode` (string)
  - Sanitizer execution mode (`subprocess` or `in_process`).
  - `subprocess` requires the dedicated `attachment_sanitizer` executable beside the node and an OS sandbox (`bwrap` on Linux or `sandbox-exec` on macOS). It fails closed when either is unavailable. `in_process` does not provide a parser isolation boundary and is not recommended for a shipping deployment.
  - Default: `subprocess`.
- `torii.attachments_sanitize_timeout_ms` (u64)
  - Sanitization timeout in milliseconds.
  - Default: 1000.
- `torii.zk_prover_enabled` (bool)
  - Enables the background prover scan worker. When disabled, no new local diagnostic reports are created.
  - Default: false.
- `torii.zk_prover_scan_period_secs` (u64)
  - Scan period for the background prover.
  - Default: 30 seconds.
- `torii.zk_prover_reports_ttl_secs` (u64)
  - Retention window for prover reports.
- `torii.zk_prover_reports_max_count` / `torii.zk_prover_reports_max_bytes`
  - Global on-disk retention geometry for report bodies plus their bounded summary shards.
  - Defaults: 4096 reports and 256 MiB. Before committing a report, the worker deterministically evicts the oldest reports until both limits are satisfied; zero count and byte budgets too small for one maximum-size report are rejected during configuration parsing.
- `torii.zk_prover_max_inflight` / `torii.zk_prover_max_scan_bytes` / `torii.zk_prover_max_scan_millis`
  - Concurrency and per-scan budgets for the prover worker.
  - Attachment discovery is inside the same wall-clock deadline, uses at most the first half of that deadline so scheduled work can make progress, and never materializes the complete multi-tenant namespace. One in-memory location slot is admitted per started 512 bytes of the byte budget (hard maximum 4096); directory work is limited to eight iterator steps per slot (hard maximum 32768). The cursor resumes on the next cycle and each bounded window is ordered canonically by tenant key and attachment id before scheduling. Discovery work exhaustion is reported as `reason="work"` alongside `bytes` and `time`.
- `torii.zk_prover_keys_dir` (path)
  - Directory holding verifying key bytes for registry entries without stored key bytes.
- `torii.zk_prover_allowed_backends` / `torii.zk_prover_allowed_circuits` (string list)
  - Allowlists for prover scope (prefix match, empty = allow all).
- `torii.zk_ivm_prove_max_inflight` / `torii.zk_ivm_prove_max_queue`
  - Shared blocking-execution concurrency and prove-queue controls for IVM prove, derive, contract simulation, and contract views.
  - When saturated, Torii rejects new jobs with `429` and a `Retry-After` hint.
- `torii.zk_ivm_tooling_timeout_ms`
  - Wall-clock deadline for derive/simulation/view. Capacity remains held until a timed-out blocking worker physically exits.
- `torii.zk_ivm_prove_job_ttl_secs` / `torii.zk_ivm_prove_job_max_entries` / `torii.zk_ivm_prove_job_max_retained_bytes`
  - Retention controls for the in-memory prove job cache used by `/v1/zk/ivm/prove/{job_id}`.
  - The default aggregate retained-byte cap is 128 MiB. Terminal responses are compact JSON cached once; GET clones immutable bytes and charges exact egress before refreshing LRU state.
  - Jobs older than `zk_ivm_prove_job_ttl_secs` are evicted. Started blocking work is discard-only on cancellation and keeps its capacity/memory reservation until physical completion.
- `torii.zk_ivm_prove_job_max_entries_per_owner` / `torii.zk_ivm_prove_job_max_retained_bytes_per_owner`
  - Per-account retained-job caps (defaults: 32 entries and 32 MiB). Admission and terminal-result growth may evict only terminal entries belonging to the same account, never another tenant's result.
  - IVM prove POST/GET/DELETE require canonical account authentication. The POST signer must match the request authority; the stored owner alone may read or delete the job, and foreign/missing identifiers share `404`.
  - IVM derive and verify-batch also require exact-network canonical account authentication before decode; derive additionally requires the signer to match its request authority.
- `torii.max_content_len` (bytes)
  - Global HTTP request body limit; applies to attachments uploads as an upper bound.
- `confidential.tree_roots_history_len` (non-zero usize)
  - Bounds recent roots returned by `/v1/zk/roots`; the effective minimum is one. Empty-root construction and tree depth are fixed by the persisted confidential-tree profile and have no runtime configuration knobs.

Access control and rate limiting:
- `torii.require_api_token` (bool) and `torii.api_tokens` (list of strings)
  - When enabled and tokens are provided, app API routes require `x-api-token: <token>` header. Unknown/missing tokens are rejected.
- `torii.query_rate_per_authority_per_sec` (Option<u32>) and `torii.query_burst_per_authority` (Option<u32>)
  - Per-authority rate limiter for app API query endpoints, including attachment reads.
- `torii.tx_rate_per_authority_per_sec` (Option<u32>) and `torii.tx_burst_per_authority` (Option<u32>)
  - Per-authority transaction submission rate limiter for `/v1/pipeline/transactions` and other tx-producing endpoints.
- `torii.api_rate_limit_bypass_cidrs` (list of CIDRs)
  - Requests from these networks bypass the rate limiter only (still subject to body size, admission, token, internal-read, and routing authorization checks).

Tip: These keys map to the `iroha_config::parameters::user::Torii` section and are threaded into Torii at startup. Environment variables exist for developer convenience (e.g., `TORII_ATTACHMENTS_TTL_SECS`), but prefer static config files in production.

## Operational Notes

- Non-consensus: attaching proofs and running the background verifier does not modify WSV or affect consensus.
- Determinism & safety: id derivation and report generation are deterministic (based on body and content type). The prover verifies proofs using configured backends; it does not generate proofs or affect consensus.
- Sanitization: gzip/zstd payloads are expanded within configured limits and only allowlisted types are stored; sanitizer metadata is captured in `provenance` and compressed-origin exports are re‑sanitized. POST and export GET acquire the same bounded physical-work lease before handler work, and cancellation keeps that lease in every blocking worker, child process, and stdout reader until it actually exits.
- Subprocess isolation: Torii rejects the node binary and differently named helpers, clears the child environment to the three sanitizer protocol variables, exposes only the helper and runtime libraries inside the filesystem sandbox, and caps both request and response streams. Official release bundles and container images ship the helper; Linux images also ship Bubblewrap.
- GC cadence: attachment GC runs every minute and removes entries older than `attachments_ttl_secs`.
- Storage hygiene: deleting an attachment removes both `.bin` and `.json`; report retention removes the corresponding node-local files under `zk_prover/reports`.
- Quota recovery: node-global accounting scans at most 20,000 tenant-root entries and 40,000 aggregate child entries, counts malformed/raw entries against those bounds, and fails closed. An enabled prover starts only after any pending attachment quota transaction is recovered successfully.
- Payloads: the prover expects `ProofAttachment`/`ProofAttachmentList` payloads (Norito or JSON). ZK1/TLV envelopes are tagged but rejected as top‑level payloads. The first-release ZK1 structural profile permits at most 64 TLVs per envelope, and repeated tags are stored once in report metadata.
- Key bytes: when a registry entry omits stored VK bytes, the prover loads bytes from `torii.zk_prover_keys_dir` using `<backend>__<name>.vk` naming.
- VK commitments are domain-separated SHA-256 hashes over the `iroha:zk:v1:vk`
  domain plus length-prefixed backend and VK bytes. Generic ledger
  `VerifyProof` and specialized proof instructions require a registry `vk_ref`;
  proof attachments do not carry verifying-key bytes.
- Proving keys: for `halo2/ipa`, the IVM prove helper (`/v1/zk/ivm/prove`) loads proving key bytes from the same directory using `<backend>__<name>.pk` naming.
  The `.pk` file is one canonical, uncompressed Norito archive containing the Halo2 `SerdeFormat::Processed` proving key plus the canonical circuit family and verifier-key commitment, and must be generated by `iroha app zk ivm derive-pk`.
  Decoding is capped at 64 MiB with explicit Norito collection, allocation, and nesting budgets; circuit-family labels are capped at 256 bytes. The commitment binds a local proving key to the registered verifier key but does not replace filesystem authenticity, so operators must protect the key directory from untrusted writes.
  The Halo2 prover emits only the `ivm-execution-v1` circuit family; other circuit ids are rejected before key parsing or proof creation.
  Halo2/Pasta uses transparent IPA parameters, not an SRS ceremony. Its generators are deterministically derived by the vendored Halo2 IPA implementation with the fixed `Halo2-Parameters` hash-to-curve domain and indexed generator inputs. Each admitted V1 circuit has one compiled domain exponent (`k=7` for IVM execution, `k=8` for Kaigi, and `k=13` for the confidential-transfer, unshield, and Kagemusha top-up circuits). Verifier-key envelopes must contain exactly one exponent (`IPAK`), circuit binding (`CID1`), and processed key (`H2VK`), in that order; the fixed exponent is checked against the `H2VK` header before deterministic generators are constructed, and the processed key is checked against the compiled circuit.
  Kagemusha's signed release archive also carries parameter encodings for artifact identity and packaging, not independent setup entropy. The first-release degree is fixed at `k=16`; every parameter payload is consumed under its signed length and SHA-256 commitment, then the runtime derives the transparent parameters locally and requires its canonical encoding to have the exact committed digest before use.
  The STARK/FRI path is also transparent and does not require a separate `.pk` or SRS artifact; its FRI domain, blowup, query, Merkle, and hash parameters are authenticated by the registered verifier key and validated against consensus floors and ceilings.
- Privacy: neither `/v1/zk/ivm/derive` nor `/v1/zk/ivm/prove` expose plaintext gas usage (`gas_used`). Gas usage is committed inside `gas_policy_commitment`.
- Execution semantics: `/v1/zk/ivm/prove` executes bytecode from the request (`authority`, `metadata`, `bytecode`) and derives the authoritative `IvmProved` payload on-node before generating `ivm-execution-v1` proof attachments (`halo2/ipa` or `stark/fri`).
- Request body: `{ vk_ref: { backend, name }, authority, metadata, bytecode, proved? }` where optional `proved` is treated as a strict consistency check against node-derived execution output.
- Nodes always replay ABI V1 bytecode deterministically during admission. The active on-chain `ivm-execution-v1` verifier-key record controls circuit admission and proof-size limits; local pipeline configuration cannot enable, disable, or bypass proved execution.
- Metrics: `torii_zk_ivm_prove_inflight` (jobs currently proving) and `torii_zk_ivm_prove_queued` (jobs queued waiting for an inflight slot) expose IVM prove helper queue pressure.

## Examples

Raw attachment `curl` calls are intentionally omitted: all five routes require
the complete canonical exact-network account-signature header set. Prefer the
CLI or an SDK signer. If `require_api_token=true`, include the configured token
in addition to those signed headers; a token alone is rejected.

CLI shortcuts (`iroha_cli`):

```bash
# Upload attachment
iroha app zk attachments upload --file ./proof.json --content-type application/json

# List/get/delete
iroha app zk attachments list
iroha app zk attachments get --id <id> --out ./downloaded.bin
iroha app zk attachments delete --id <id>

# IVM prove helper (submit/poll) and proving-key derivation
iroha app zk ivm prove --json ./ivm_prove_request.json --wait
iroha app zk ivm get --job-id <job_id>
iroha app zk ivm delete --job-id <job_id>
iroha app zk ivm derive-pk --vk ./halo2_ipa__ivm-exec-v1.vk --out ./halo2_ipa__ivm-exec-v1.pk
```

See also: the ZK vote tally convenience endpoint (`POST /v1/zk/vote/tally`) and CLI helper `iroha app zk vote tally` for inspecting election tallies. Successful tally responses include `evaluated_block_height` and `evaluated_block_hash` from the same immutable state view used for lookup; unknown election identifiers return `404`.

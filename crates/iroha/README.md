# Iroha Client

This is the reusable client library for the first Hyperledger Iroha 3 release.
Use it to build applications that communicate with Iroha peers over HTTP and
WebSocket.

This crate is the reusable Rust SDK surface. The `iroha` command-line binary is
built from the separate [`iroha_cli`](../iroha_cli) crate.

Follow the [Iroha 3 Rust tutorial](https://docs.iroha.tech/guide/tutorials/rust.html)
for setup, configuration, and client examples.

## Features

* Submit one or several Iroha Special Instructions (ISI) as a Transaction to Iroha Peer
* Read Torii collections with one filter, sort and cursor language
* Request data based on Iroha Queries from a Peer

Transaction finality waits require state-resolved `Applied` status. Temporary
HTTP 429 responses repeat only the status read, respecting Torii's delta-seconds
`Retry-After` and the original wait deadline. They never resubmit the transaction;
an exhausted deadline retains the last backpressure diagnostic.

Ordinary Native custody and production proving are required in every supported
build; disabling default features does not remove them. Installed inventory
metadata retains its 16-GiB
artifact and aggregate limit as `u64`, including on 32-bit targets. Held originals
are hashed through bounded streaming reads. Loading bytes and resolving artifacts
still require checked address-sized allocation bounds; the metadata limit does
not promise a 16-GiB allocation. Host component tests do not admit an Android
release or establish hardware or monetary qualification.

## Setup

**Requirements:** install
[Rust 1.93.1](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started), the toolchain pinned
for this workspace in the repository-root `rust-toolchain.toml`.

Add the following to the manifest file of your Rust project:

```toml
iroha = { git = "https://github.com/hyperledger-iroha/iroha.git", rev = "<IROHA_COMMIT>", package = "iroha" }
```

Pin `<IROHA_COMMIT>` to the revision deployed by your network. For a local
checkout, use `iroha = { path = "/path/to/iroha/crates/iroha" }`.

### Diagnostics

The client emits its diagnostics as [`tracing`](https://docs.rs/tracing) events;
install a `tracing` subscriber to see them. The SDK does not enable tracing's
`log` forwarding, so applications that only install a `log` logger receive no
client events by default. To forward them to `log`, enable the feature in your
own manifest:

```toml
tracing = { version = "0.1", features = ["log"] }
```

## Client construction

Construct an asynchronous client with `Client::builder(config).build()?`.
The builder validates the endpoint, signing authority, address discriminant and
HTTP headers. Configure headers with `headers(...)`, HTTP transport with
`http_transport(Arc<dyn iroha::http::HttpTransport>)`, and WebSocket transport with
`stream_transport(Arc<dyn iroha::stream::StreamTransport>)` on the builder.
Configuration is fixed after construction; transport initialization failures
are returned through `iroha::Error`. The explicit blocking HTTP constructor is
`iroha::blocking::Client::with_http_transport(config, transport)?`.

Clones share their HTTP and stream transports and compatibility decision. To
change configuration, copy it with `client.to_builder()`, edit the builder, and
call `build()` to obtain a new context with a fresh compatibility cache and probe
coordinator. The copied builder retains both selected transports. When selecting
a different origin, choose its HTTP and operator credentials explicitly.

Bind account operations with `client.account_client()?` and privileged operations
with `client.operator_client(operator_key_pair)?`. Synchronous applications use
`iroha::blocking`, which owns a reusable runtime and rejects calls from an async
runtime. Remaining synchronous capability methods and authority-owned operations
are tracked in the repository's first-release architecture redesign record.

Signed Iroha queries use `account.query_single(query).await?` for singular
lookups such as `FindAccountById`. Iterable signed queries
(`account.query(query)` with `iroha::query::AsyncQueryBuilderExt` imported)
stream typed rows through `execute().await?` and `next().await`. Each
continuation consumes its cursor before dispatch; a failed or cancelled
continuation ends that stream and cannot replay the signed request. When the
node reports more rows but returns no continuation cursor, the stream ends with
`QueryError::Truncated` instead of stopping silently. List collections with the
collection queries below.

## Collection queries

Domains, accounts, asset definitions, NFTs, RWA lots, account assets, asset
holders, transactions, account transactions and repo agreements share one query
language and one page envelope; the wire contract is
`specs/torii/collection_queries.md`.
Build a `ListQuery` with `iroha::collections` and read a `Collection`:

```rust
use iroha::{
    Error,
    client::Client,
    collections::{Collection, FilterExpr, ListQuery, SortKey, TryStreamExt as _, field},
    config::Config,
};

async fn list_definitions() -> eyre::Result<()> {
    let client = Client::builder(Config::load_file("client.toml")?).build()?;

    // Filter, sort and page size. `field(..)` builders and text filters
    // produce the same tree; `&`, `|` and `!` combine conditions.
    let query = ListQuery::new()
        .filter(field("owned_by").eq("sorau…") & field("metadata.tier").is_not_null())
        .sort_by(SortKey::desc("id"))
        .limit(50);
    let same: FilterExpr = r#"owned_by = "sorau…" and metadata.tier is not null"#.parse()?;
    assert_eq!(query.filter.as_ref(), Some(&same));

    // One page and its continuation.
    let page = client.list_page(&Collection::AssetDefinitions, &query).await?;
    if let Some(next) = query.next_page(&page) {
        let _second = client.list_page(&Collection::AssetDefinitions, &next).await?;
    }

    // Every row: `next_cursor` is followed lazily until the last page.
    let mut rows = client.list(Collection::AssetDefinitions, query);
    while let Some(row) = rows.try_next().await? {
        println!("{:?}", row.get("id"));
    }

    // Torii rejections carry the `{code, message, details}` envelope.
    let bad = ListQuery::new().filter(field("colour").eq("red"));
    match client.list_page(&Collection::AssetDefinitions, &bad).await {
        Err(Error::Api { error, .. }) if error.code() == "invalid_filter" => {
            let details = error.details();
            eprintln!(
                "{}; accepted fields: {:?}",
                error.message(),
                details.and_then(|details| details.expected())
            );
        }
        other => {
            other?;
        }
    }
    Ok(())
}
```

`Client` reads are public and unsigned. `client.account_client()?.list_page(..)`
and `.list(..)` add the account's canonical request signature, which only widens
visibility into restricted dataspaces; multisignature member contexts read
publicly. Parameterised collections carry their subject:
`Collection::AccountAssets(account_id)`, `Collection::AssetHolders(definition_id)`
and `Collection::AccountTransactions(account_id)`.

`Collection::Transactions` and `Collection::AccountTransactions` are history
collections (`Collection::is_history`): rows arrive newest first by
`block_height`, then `block_index`, and `sort`, `include_total` and `aggregate`
are rejected. A page may hold fewer rows than `limit`, or none, and still carry
a `next_cursor`; `list` keeps following it until it is absent. Bounds on
`block_height` in the filter's top-level `and` also bound Torii's scan, as in
`field("block_height").gte(1_200) & field("result_ok").eq(true)`. Aggregates
over rows that span several dataspace routes are rejected with
`invalid_aggregate`; page through the rows instead. Object and array literals
(only valid against `metadata.<key>`) exist only in the JSON form that the SDK
sends.

Queries are validated before dispatch: a query Torii would reject returns
`Error::InvalidListQuery` with the same code. `Error::code()` returns the code of
either error; `ApiError` also exposes the HTTP status, `details.field` (the
offending control), `expected`, `actual`, `hint`, the `x-iroha-reject-code`
header and `Retry-After`. Responses without an envelope remain `Error::Http`.

The blocking facade signs with its bound account and returns a lazy iterator:

```rust
use iroha::collections::{Collection, ListQuery};

fn print_domains(client: &iroha::blocking::Client) -> iroha::Result<()> {
    for domain in client.list(Collection::Domains, ListQuery::new().limit(200)) {
        println!("{:?}", domain?.get("id"));
    }
    Ok(())
}
```

## Node diagnostics

Use `client.status().get().await?` for the typed status document and
`client.status().version().await?` for the API version. Synchronous applications
use the same capability through `iroha::blocking::Client`, without `.await`.
The operation selects one response representation, enforces the context deadline
and rejects oversized or ambiguously labelled responses. Transport errors retain
their I/O category in `TransportErrorKind`; HTTP errors retain their bounded body.

Bind an operator with `client.operator_client(operator_key_pair)?`, then use
`operator.consensus().diagnostics().await?` for queue pressure, NPoS election state
and lane governance readiness. Synchronous callers use the same capability on
`iroha::blocking::OperatorClient`. These observations do not authenticate finality.

Public Nexus reads use `client.nexus().validator_committee(target_epoch).await?`
and `client.nexus().prepare_public_lane_plan(&request).await?`. The corresponding
capability on `iroha::blocking::Client` drives the same implementation. Committee
attachments still require independent native chain and genesis authentication.

Submission discovers the node's data-model version and signed-transaction schema
through public `/v1/node/capabilities` metadata before dispatching transaction
bytes. This probe omits canonical account authentication so a fresh account can
submit its registration. Configured transport headers, deadlines, response bounds
and exact version/schema checks still apply.

## Operator configuration

Bind the operator with `client.operator_client(operator_key_pair)?`, then read
`operator.configuration().get().await?`. The returned shared DTO includes the
confidential gas schedule. Configuration uses one operator-signed JSON request,
the context deadline and an 8-MiB response ceiling.

For synchronous operator-only work, construct
`iroha::blocking::OperatorClient::from_client(operator)?` and call
`operator.configuration().get()?`. This facade owns a reusable runtime without
requiring an account context. Public and account contexts have no configuration
capability.

## Event and block streams

Bind `let account = client.account_client()?`, then use
`account.events().subscribe(filters).await?` or
`account.blocks().subscribe(height).await?`. Filters must be nonempty; block
height is `NonZeroU64`, and the account must hold `CanReadAllLedgerData` to read
full signed blocks. These capabilities belong only to the account context.
Both sign the exact upgrade and use the `iroha-norito-v1` WebSocket subprotocol.

The owned streams implement `Stream<Item = iroha::Result<EventBox>>` or
`Stream<Item = iroha::Result<SignedBlock>>`. Initial subscription messages are
limited to 256 KiB and received messages to 64 MiB, including fragmentation.
Upgrade response bodies are limited to 64 KiB. Connection establishment and the
initial send share `torii_request_timeout`; zero disables that deadline.
Receiving has no implicit lifetime deadline. Use an async timeout when a read
needs one.

Call `stream.close().await?` to flush a close frame and release the connection.
Close uses the context request timeout, or five seconds when that timeout is
zero. A normal peer close (1000) ends the stream; abnormal close codes and reasons
remain in `Error::StreamClosed`. Decode, transport and protocol failures terminate
the stream. Dropping it releases I/O; it does not spawn cleanup or reconnect work.
Subscriptions never redirect, retry, resume or replay automatically.

`last_message_bytes()` reports the complete binary message size for the last
item delivered, including malformed binary messages. It is `None` before the
first item or after a transport failure without a delivered binary message.
Pending reads, local receive timeouts and normal completion preserve the last
observation. This metadata also exists on blocking streams. HTTP errors retain
an unambiguous `Retry-After` delta as `retry_after`; it is a hint for caller-owned
policy and never causes the SDK to retry.

For synchronous code, use
`iroha::blocking::AccountClient::from_client(account)?`, then the same capability
without `.await`. Its stream uses the reusable owned runtime:
`recv(Some(duration))` bounds one wait, `recv(None)` waits without an idle timeout,
and `close()` returns a typed result. `Ok(None)` means normal completion; a wait
expiry returns `Error::Timeout { operation: "stream.receive" }` and permits another
receive on the same subscription. Blocking calls reject execution inside an async
runtime. Custom stream connectors implement `StreamTransport` and `StreamSocket`;
the SDK retains request signing, protocol checks, deadlines and typed decoding.

## Subscription drafts

Subscription preparation returns a typed `SubscriptionDraft`; its payload variant
owns `Box<TransactionPayload>`, and its instruction variant owns the instruction
list. Its JSON representation retains the `kind` and `value` fields. Preparation
futures are `Send`, and signing remains an explicit account operation.

## Examples

We highly recommend looking at the sample [`iroha_cli`](../iroha_cli) binary
crate, which builds the `iroha` executable, as well as our
[tutorial](https://docs.iroha.tech/guide/tutorials/rust.html) for more examples
and explanations.

### Address formatting

`account_address::encode_account_id_to_i105(&account, network_prefix)` requires
an explicit address prefix. Obtain it from an immutable client with
`client.account_chain_discriminant()` when rendering an address for that
context. Concurrent clients can render different networks without changing
process-global settings. The SDK helper module exposes no global prefix setter
or getter; the data model's remaining default-formatting API is separate work.

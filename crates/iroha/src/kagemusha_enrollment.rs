//! Middleware adapter for current KAGEMUSHA enrollment eligibility.
//!
//! Mount this adapter behind the bank's authenticated issuer-to-middleware endpoint. Resolve
//! the canonical account and actor together in the bank's customer directory, then read current
//! approval and freeze state in one transaction. No KYC documents leave the bank. An operator
//! selected by the authenticated asset/scheme owner uses the same protocol and binding checks.
//!
//! The issuer authenticates current authority/routing independently, retains each fresh request
//! before dispatch, and consumes its response at the named durable enrollment boundary. This
//! adapter does not install a trust root or issue a wallet credential.

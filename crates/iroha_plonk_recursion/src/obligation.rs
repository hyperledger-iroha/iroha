//! Fixed incoming-claim modes and the constrained burn/no-op verdict.
//!
//! The branch rule is Lambda §2.7. It never gates a predecessor, own step,
//! Q proof or A proof. A consuming relation must separately bind every mode
//! to its fixed obligation slot, select the corresponding accumulator and
//! require a Corrected commitment to differ from the original. This module
//! establishes the mode rule; it does not decide an accumulator.

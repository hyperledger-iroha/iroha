# KAGEMUSHA recursive proof components

This crate implements the native accumulator and fold algorithms in
[`kagemusha_lambda_omega_v1.md`](../../specs/kagemusha_lambda_omega_v1.md)
§§3.3–3.4 and §8, the complete constrained PIPA-R and PIPA-AS succinct
verifiers, and the incoming-mode rule and static obligation ledger. Component
constraints and native equivalence are tested; recursive relation composition
and release qualification remain open.

`codec` links exact 32-byte messages to canonical proof scalars and finite points,
including total soft decoders with fixed dummies. Scalar cells retain injective
S6 limbs. The transcript absorbs Pallas scalars as two limbs and Vesta scalars
as one native word. Its challenge map proves the canonical base-field integer
and Vesta's exact conditional subtraction of p. Instance membership separately
proves `Field`, `Bounded` and `Bits(0..253)`; consumers must include every soft
verdict in their acceptance predicate.

Scalar cells retain the opaque `gadgets::ff::CanonicalS6` certificate across
byte decoding and the exact 87-bit foreign-arithmetic bridge. Internal arithmetic
keeps tracked bounded integers; comparisons, zero/inverse guards, curve scalar
bits, transcripts and public exports retain canonicality proofs. Reuse is keyed
by exact proving-cell identities, never witness values. The existing FF carry
and quotient envelope remains unchanged.

`codec::foreign` total-decodes Vesta accumulator bytes inside the Fp relation,
including the constrained square/nonsquare witness and canonical sign. Invalid
bytes retain a false verdict and select the pinned finite accumulator dummy.

`AccumulatorT` encodes exactly 544 bytes (`G`, sixteen nonzero challenges).
`FoldInput` checks source k and leading-zero padding. `FoldWitness` encodes a
canonical 32-byte base-field salt followed by the 1,088-byte non-hiding IPA
body. These fixed protocol encodings have no implicit tags or alternate decoder.

`create_fold` opens `h − h(z)e_0`, self-checks its succinct equation, and returns
an undecided accumulator. `verify_fold` also returns an undecided accumulator;
call `decide` before accepting it. The decision uses the independent complete
MSM kernel. All Horner joins are complete, including identity intermediates.

At least one explicitly supplied source-k16 slot is required. Short-only
callers add `AccumulatorT::trivial(...).as_input()` as an additional fixed slot
in their bound input list. No function silently appends a slot. This prevents
the necessarily zero first L point of a non-hiding, short-only polynomial.
Rare identity messages and zero round challenges are errors, not panics or
implicit salt retries.

`FoldInput::corrected` computes a deciding replacement, requires a different G,
and retains the original claim. The consuming relation must still authorize
Corrected mode and bind both claims; this native helper does not authorize burn.

The prover owns at most 8 MiB of polynomial, powers and generator work vectors
at k16, borrows pinned parameters, and admits bounded generator chunks and MSM
scratch through `FoldConfig`. No runtime environment switch controls behavior.

The full k16 adversarial tests are ignored in the default debug suite. Run
`cargo test -p iroha_plonk_recursion --release -- --include-ignored` to exercise
both curves, fixed proof/output vectors, input binding and independent decisions.

`verifier` follows the descriptor's transcript, expression, opening and IPA
tables. Hard mode requires the exact verdict; soft mode checks every decode and
equation and returns a fixed source-k dummy on failure. `accumulation_circuit`
uses the same arithmetic and transcript lanes for local folds. Incoming mode
selection binds the selected k, point and challenges: Trivial uses the pinned
k16 accumulator, while Accept and Corrected retain the original source k.

`obligation` constrains the global incoming-mode rule and enumerates the fixed
per-operation ledger. Consuming relations still bind each slot's authenticated
source, mode and claim and must close both curves' generator decisions.

TODO: complete relation-level composition and obligation-ledger integration,
independent reference-verifier fixtures,
and the M4 Fiat–Shamir/composition security review before artifact qualification.
The current generic wrapper exceeds the transport cap; compact layout and
composed row/performance qualification remain release gates.

`tests/compact_components.rs` exercises shared Glue, complete ECC, transcript,
CRT, dot-product and algebraic/running-sum range constraints. The explicit compact
profile has eleven advice columns, twelve fixed columns, one lookup and direct
public gates. The staged CRT kernel binds five intermediate products. Unsigned
Proper single products with modulus above 2^254 use the separately reviewed
three-carry finish. Unsigned dots additionally use three carries only when every
input has a structural strict 255-bit bound and the modulus lies between 2^254
and 2^255. Staged Pasta results explicitly range their top limb to81 bits and
preserve that bound through copies; selection takes the wider arm bound. Lazy
inputs, division and wider dots retain their original carry admission. Its constant values
are constrained through fixed Glue coefficients on the same bounded shared
cursor. The current degree-nine descriptor has 3,680 proof bytes plus the
1,088-byte accumulator: **4,768 bytes**, within the 4,821-byte cap. This is a
descriptor result; a complete production compact proof has not been generated.

An explicit two-bus serialized Qσ profile produces a natively verified 7,008-byte
proof for the complete two-sigma plus AS relation. Single k12/k14 and soft
Trivial cases retain exact byte/public bindings and known/unknown shape.
The default Q profile remains unchanged pending composed catalog qualification.
Using Q2, the actual authenticated Bootstrap three-bus source A2 proof is 7,872
bytes and its busiest range lane occupies 65,283 rows. Its complete compact
Omega predicate passes in a diagnostic larger domain, requiring 63,889 shared
rows with a pinned one-key catalog and 97,993 range rows. The exact tagged range
table removes shifted-top rows: one `(width,value)` lookup contains the 65,528
tuples for widths3..15, and algebraic roots check widths1/2. Its added fixed tag
query is offset by removing the previous-row advice query, preserving 4,768
transport bytes. The earlier
five-bus Load snapshot used 72,376 shared and 130,406 range rows; that evidence
precedes later engine changes and also omits the complete per-step C4 current
credential/certificate authorization. It is partial-relation evidence only.
A fresh Q2/A4 Bootstrap candidate with narrow dots, exact constant reuse,
small-quotient lazy reduction and bounded Pasta three-carry products/divisions
produces 8,480-byte A proofs and uses 64,928 shared / 94,792 range rows
in pinned compact Omega. The shared lane fits the production k16 budget;
**the range lane still exceeds it by 29,262 rows.** The
compact measurement uses only a Bootstrap terminal key; it is not the release
catalog. A separate generic Bootstrap/Load two-terminal diagnostic binds the
actual common Omega digest before constructing both lineages and checks exact
initial/rebound terminal keys. Its uncompressed outer proof is10,272 bytes plus
1,088 bytes of accumulator, and remains over the cap. The ordinary scalar-table Q2/A3 Load candidate still exceeds k16 at 68,760
range rows. The explicit tagged-table A3 candidate now completes all four
genuine corrected Load stages, whose maximum rows are 55,611 / 61,808 /
57,646 / 58,164. Every actual source proof is 7,744 bytes. The matching
Bootstrap compact diagnostic uses 62,849 shared / 94,033 range rows with a
4,768-byte descriptor transport estimate. It still fails the range limit by
28,503 rows. This is source feasibility for Bootstrap/Load, with the full
catalog rebind, Send and final compact proof remaining open.

The explicit parallel serialized-FF profile keeps the verifier lanes parallel.
Its fixed bank gives each range bus an independent lookup against one
shared table. The named tagged profile uses exact `(width, value)` tuples
within each independent argument; it does not combine independent values
into one tuple membership claim.
Placement depends only on structural row counts. Same-cell range certificates
reuse a proven narrower bound only within one synthesis. Native differential
tests cover both curves, honest and malformed proofs, total soft verdicts,
hard rejection and known/unknown shape.

Unsigned Proper batches of at most eight products share a single quotient/result/
carry certificate set. The compact streaming kernel uses `2*n+3` arithmetic
rows; the parallel reference lowering uses `20+11*(n-1)`. S11 Horner evaluation
and unsigned sums use these batches, explicitly reducing inputs to Proper first.
Negation and semantic-boundary canonicalization retain their original checks.
Final source artifacts, full key catalog, actual compact outer proofs and
composed row/performance qualification remain open.

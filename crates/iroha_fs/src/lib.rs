//! Retained native filesystem authority for private Iroha runtime material.

//! Private directories and files belong to the effective user. Operations reject links,
//! traversal, shared file custody and replaced ancestors; reads retain and recheck the original
//! descriptor. Unix uses descriptor-relative operations, owner modes and directory `fsync`.
//! Windows uses protected current-user DACLs, retained non-delete-sharing ancestor handles,
//! reparse rejection, file IDs and write-through native publication. No codec or network policy
//! belongs in this crate. Filesystem/media honesty remains an operating-system assumption.
//! A separate read-only build-input owner retains Cargo's legitimate initial hardlink count;
//! it supplies no private-file or installed-program authority and refuses later source changes.

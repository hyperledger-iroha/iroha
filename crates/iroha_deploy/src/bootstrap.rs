//! Independently signed, bounded native checkpoints for developer-network bootstrap.
//!
//! The installed release selects [`ReleaseTrust`]; an HTTP response never supplies its key.
//! Authentication binds the network, reset generation, endpoints and complete native checkpoint.
//! [`ReleaseCheckpointStore`] retains a monotonic release watermark in owner-private storage.
//! This is bootstrap provenance, not a fresh committee readiness observation: callers still use
//! [`FinalityVerifier::observe`] before admitting operations on the parent network.
//! A running verifier retains its own advancing checkpoint; a release must never replace that
//! checkpoint with an older tip. Changing the installed authority fails closed against retained
//! releases and requires an independently authenticated key-rotation migration.
// The maintained `kagami network-bootstrap` publisher requires independently selected public
// policy, signed parent genesis and native checkpoint before opening release-signing custody.

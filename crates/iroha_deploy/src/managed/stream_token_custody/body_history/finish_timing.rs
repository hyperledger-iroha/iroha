//! Opt-in numeric attribution for the existing genuine deep-history test only.
//! Nested phase totals are inclusive; they must not be added together as exclusive work.
//! Closure subphases run only inside an existing prepare/finish timer and that same capture.
//! Attempt record totals include the optional native read and, when present, its canonical
//! decoder. Decode subphases cover only `decode_record`, including its canonical re-encode;
//! absent leaves and native refusals before the callback have no decode sample. Scoped reads
//! exclude their caller's directory/tree entry and exit. Inventory subphases surround only
//! the original `entries` calls: ordinary calls include full ancestry checks, scoped calls
//! include native census work under the caller's separate entry/exit fences. No interval
//! measures wallet decoding or body snapshots, and overlapping totals are not additive.

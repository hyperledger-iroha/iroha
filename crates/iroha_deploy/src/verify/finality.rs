//! Bounded, contiguous native finality verification for deployment observations.
//!
//! Trust starts at independently authenticated signed genesis or an operator-selected complete
//! native checkpoint. Every successor is verified; a supplied committee, context digest or proof
//! is never promoted to its own trust root. Fresh BLS attestations require `2f + 1` distinct
//! members of the authenticated tip committee. The native checkpoint retains exact predecessor
//! decisions, allowing one-block-lagging members to count across an epoch boundary.
//!
//! Height-one outputs have no QC. They require a certified successor or independent committee
//! attestations; merely constructing a verifier does not authenticate genesis execution.
//!
//! Certificates, committees and epoch handoffs are checked by the data model's contiguous
//! [`SumeragiFinalityVerifier`]: each successor must carry an exact `2f + 1` commit certificate
//! of the committee that its authenticated predecessor scheduled, and an epoch boundary's
//! certified result is the only source of the next committee. Work is proportional to new
//! blocks rather than new epochs: parent-result, schedule and beacon-seed bindings are checked
//! between adjacent certified blocks, and the canonical checkpoint retains the exact decisions
//! of the tip's two predecessors.
//!
//! An observation verifies one contiguous prefix, each height at most once, and places every
//! member's claimed tip on it. A claim that fails verification or exceeds the budget is reported
//! for that member alone, so a Byzantine member cannot abort the observation or spend the budget
//! that honest tips need. A checkpoint lagging by more than one observation budget is caught up
//! across observations ([`FinalityError::CatchingUp`]) or explicitly in pages
//! ([`FinalityVerifier::catch_up`]).
// TODO(P2): provide the native HTTP transport and concurrent bounded peer reads.

//! ABI V1 whole-invocation semantic and proof-coverage inventory.
//!
//! This module is a coverage guard, not a proof system. It lists every admitted
//! opcode, every `abi_syscall_list()` entry, every [`VmTrapKind`](crate::VmTrapKind),
//! every [`VMError`](crate::VMError) variant and every numeric/pointer ABI fault,
//! maps each to the relation obligations a complete native invocation proof
//! must discharge, and records which unregistered proof components currently
//! hold equations for it. Nothing here constrains a witness, authorizes
//! `IvmProved` admission or substitutes for the relation.
//!
//! Completion stays open while [`COMPLETE_RELATION`] is `None`, while any entry
//! is not [`CoverageStatus::Complete`], or while [`OPEN_SEMANTICS`] is nonempty;
//! [`completion_blockers`] names each reason separately. There is no default
//! syscall exclusion list: [`DEFAULT_SYSCALL_EXCLUSIONS`] is empty and an
//! unmapped syscall, opcode or fault fails the source-checked tests in this
//! module.
//!
//! The typed tables are the source of truth. The tracked machine-readable
//! artifact at [`INVENTORY_ARTIFACT_PATH`] is rendered from them by
//! [`render_inventory_json`] and must be regenerated with
//! `cargo run --locked -p ivm --features dev-tools --bin gen_proof_coverage_inventory -- --write`.

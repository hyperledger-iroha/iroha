//! IVM Syscall Table (ABI v1)

This document lists IVM syscall numbers and their ABI for `abi_version = 1`.
The host and VM enforce the fixed first-release ABI v1 policy: the set of
available syscalls is fixed and unknown or disallowed numbers must be rejected
with `E_SCALL_UNKNOWN` (mapped to `VMError::UnknownSyscall`). The canonical
policy is centralized in `ivm::syscalls::is_syscall_allowed(policy, number)`.

ABI policy
- V1 (1): allows the canonical ABI surface listed here and in `abi_syscall_list()`; unknown numbers
  are rejected uniformly across all hosts. The list is kept sorted/deduplicated and the golden test
  fails if ordering or contents drift.
- `abi_hash` commits to every sorted allowed syscall number, its canonical argument and return
  signatures, its conservative host-access class, every sorted allowed pointer-ABI type ID, and
  the complete ABI-v1 semantic descriptor. That descriptor includes numeric domains, arithmetic
  rules, canonical JSON grammars, fault ordering, the CNTR marker/framing, nominal contract-interface
  and state-type schema identities, every embedded state-type tag/layout/sample frame, admission and
  depth rules, and typed durable-state schema/record identities, enum tags, layouts, traversal rules,
  pointer mappings, caps, operation-specific state paths, and CNTR-bound read/write record validation.
  It also binds the generic-program discriminator, reserved transaction metadata,
  and exact sorted list of syscalls unavailable without an authenticated contract identity.
  Display names and gas prices are not part of this digest.
  `ivm::gas::schedule_hash()` commits to the canonical gas schedule and every staged-metering phase
  name/tag independently.
- Every allowed syscall must have exactly one explicit row in `spec/syscalls.toml`. Documentation
  generation rejects missing, duplicate, or extra rows instead of inventing an ABI signature from
  naming heuristics.
- First release: ABI v1 is the only supported policy. `abi_version != 1` is rejected at admission,
  and runtime upgrades must keep `abi_version = 1` without expanding the syscall or pointer‑ABI
  surface. Tightening the unreleased V1 descriptor changes its hash, not its version; artifacts with
  any older V1 hash fail closed at admission.

Admission/host guardrails
- Admission enforces manifest `code_hash`/`abi_hash` equality for both inline metadata manifests and
  WSV‑stored manifests before execution, returning `ManifestCodeHashMismatch`/`ManifestAbiHashMismatch`
  deterministically.
- A program without a canonical `CNTR` section is Generic. It retains pure
  compute, numeric, codec, crypto, output, query, and ordinary permission-checked
  ISI syscalls, but admission and host dispatch both reject the ABI-bound
  `GENERIC_PROGRAM_DENIED_SYSCALLS_V1` list with
  `GenericSyscallNotAllowed(syscall)` before side effects. The denied list covers
  contract-entrypoint grants, contract code/lifecycle administration, durable
  state, the opaque contract instruction bridge, nested contract calls, and
  contract-identity sysvars. Generic transaction metadata may not carry the
  reserved contract/deployment keys bound by the descriptor.
- Admission decodes the instruction stream and rejects `SCALL` numbers outside the ABI surface with
  `ValidationFail::NotPermitted` before execution, so mutated or malformed bytecode never reaches the
  host.
- Runtime hosts must return `VMError::UnknownSyscall` for disallowed syscall numbers; the executor
  surfaces the failure during validation so contracts cannot rely on undefined syscalls. Allowed
  syscall numbers that are not meaningful for a specific host return a metered
  `VMError::NotImplemented` instead.
- The five extended `0x00FE0001..=0x00FE0005` Kotodama test helpers are not ABI-v1 syscalls and do
  not contribute to `abi_hash`. A crate-private test-artifact verifier accepts exactly those IDs
  only in unreachable local test bodies, and the VM dispatches them only when the private
  test-suite loader capability is present and the host opts in; the runner supplies
  `KotoTestHost`. Production artifact admission, public raw/program/prepared loaders, adjacent
  `0x00FE` IDs, and permissive custom hosts all fail with `VMError::UnknownSyscall`.
- Reserved-metering host calls compute a deterministic, side-effect-free upper gas quote before
  dispatch, debit it before effects, and reconcile unused reserve afterward. Numeric V1 calls use
  staged metering instead: each phase is debited immediately before its bounded work, and no staged
  charge is refunded. The schedule hash binds both the per-syscall metering mode and every staged
  phase tag.
- Regression tests cover host-side `UnknownSyscall` rejections, admission-time `SCALL` gating
  (including manifest-backed programs), and manifest `abi_hash` enforcement across both metadata and
  WSV manifests to keep the ABI surface deterministic end-to-end.

`SCALL` carries an 8-bit syscall number in bytecode. `SYSTEM` is the extended `SCALLX` form and carries a 24-bit syscall number for the first-release ABI surface that does not fit in the legacy byte slot. The host receives all syscall numbers as `u32`, and admission checks both encodings before execution. Structured arguments use the pointer‑ABI: canonical Norito TLVs may reside in INPUT, the allocated HEAP prefix, or at an exact loader-validated literal start. Stack, OUTPUT, unallocated HEAP, and arbitrary code offsets are not valid pointer provenance. Scalar values are passed in `r10+`. Return values are `u64` unless noted; pointer results are returned in `r10` and host-produced TLVs prefer INPUT before spilling to allocated HEAP.

Query syscall (Norito)
- `0xA1` and extended `0x010000` expect `r10=&NoritoBytes(QueryRequest)` and return `r10=&NoritoBytes(QueryResponse)`. The authority is always the calling contract; embedded authorities are ignored.
- Iterable queries run in ephemeral cursor mode inside IVM; `QueryRequest::Continue` is rejected to keep query lifetimes bound to the VM run.
- `pipeline.query_max_fetch_size` caps iterable query `fetch_size` for IVM query syscalls (0 clamps to 1). Torii endpoints continue to use `torii.app_api.max_fetch_size`.
- Gas is `base + per_item + per_byte`, with per-item cost multiplied when sorting is requested and an offset penalty applied for large pagination skips.

Vendor syscall (Norito)
- `0xA0` expects `r10=&NoritoBytes(InstructionBox)` and a mandatory operation tag in `r11`: `1` for `SubmitBallot` or `2` for `RecordSccpMessage`. Tag `0`, unknown tags, mismatched instruction types, and other instruction types are rejected.

Ordering and OUTPUT
- Syscalls execute in program order. Hosts must apply their side effects in the order received.
- `COMMIT_OUTPUT (0xFE)` makes the VM OUTPUT region visible to the host. Programs may write multiple times to OUTPUT, but content becomes observable only after `COMMIT_OUTPUT` runs. If `COMMIT_OUTPUT` is called multiple times, hosts should treat the last call’s contents as final for that run.
- The VM clears OUTPUT (and resets its append-only cursor) when loading a program; within a run, OUTPUT writes must move forward (rewinds trap).
- Event emission that reflects syscall outcomes must preserve syscall order. VM implementations must not reorder syscalls, including under acceleration. Deterministic overlays and commit phases in the node preserve this ordering across the pipeline.
- Host lifecycle: `begin_tx`/`finish_tx` return `Result`; hosts must surface overlay flush errors (e.g., durable state writes) instead of swallowing them, clear staged overlays on failure, and rely on checkpoints to restore pre-tx state when a VM run aborts.
- Deployed-contract overlays, including deterministic `IvmProved` replay, retain the selected entrypoint authorization for every queued effect and every physical durable-state path. Apply revalidates the exact caller permission, address/code/alias binding, nested caller lineage, and path ownership before effects and again immediately before each durable write; stale or structurally incomplete replay metadata applies no effects.

Legend
- Args: registers and pointer types; `&Type` indicates a provenance-valid pointer to a canonical Norito TLV.
- Return: `u64` or `ptr` (pointer in `r10`).
- Gas: base component name; variable components are added for byte or item counts.

Gas enforcement (CoreHost)
- Syscall quotes are reserved before host effects. The reserved amount remains visible to host
  budget checks, but nested contract bytecode can spend only the unreserved parent gas. Unused
  reserve is refunded after the host reports the actual deterministic cost. This lifecycle applies
  only to calls whose registry entry is `Reserved`; numeric V1 registry entries are `Staged` and
  debit their hash-bound work phases without reservation or refund.
- `JSON_GET_JSON` quotes heap-backed JSON input against the owned HEAP/INPUT payload bound and
  reserves that same HEAP-capable result bound plus its sum handle, so a valid field beyond the
  fixed INPUT arena cannot be rejected during preparation or exceed its pre-dispatch quote.
- Host-state-dependent public-input and WSV ZK read results reserve the available syscall gas,
  compute and preflight their exact encoded cost, and only then allocate the result. This keeps
  valid HEAP-sized responses inside the dispatcher quote without mutating registers on
  insufficient gas.
- ISI syscalls charge extra gas using the native ISI schedule (`iroha_core::gas::meter_instruction`).
- FASTPQ transfer batch scope syscalls charge the fixed gas. Gas: `G_fastpq_batch`; batch
  entries are charged separately with the transfer gas family when applied.
- Contract administration bridge syscalls charge `G_contract_admin + bytes`.
- `CALL_CONTRACT` charges `G_call_contract + request bytes + return bytes` in
  the parent VM; child execution gas is consumed by the child VM.
- Native asset escrow bridge syscalls charge `G_escrow + bytes`.
- Soracloud runtime syscalls charge `G_soracloud + request bytes + response bytes`.
- ZK verification uses the immutable `ZkGasScheduleV1` snapshot selected when
  the host is constructed: `proof_base` per proof, `per_public_input` per
  canonical 32-byte public-input unit, and `per_proof_byte` for encoded request
  and bounded response bytes. The ABI-v1 defaults are `250_000`, `2_000`, and
  `5`. A request may contain at most 1 MiB of encoded payload, and
  `ZK_VERIFY_BATCH` accepts at most 16 proofs. The formula version, caps,
  response layout, and default schedule subhash are part of the hashed gas
  schedule; production rate selection is also bound by the ZK policy hash.
- GET_PUBLIC_INPUT charges a base plus a per-byte cost based on the returned TLV length.
- `JSON_OBJECT` helper — Gas: `G_json + bytes`.
- `JSON_GET_*` helpers and their direct variants return compiler-owned
  `Option<T>` sum handles. Missing keys, non-object roots, and type/conversion
  mismatches are `Option::none`; malformed TLVs remain VM errors. Gas: `G_json_get + input bytes + active payload + sum allocation`.
- `JSON_BUILD` converts one compiler-emitted `JsonConstructionSchemaV1` and a
  flattened word table into one canonical `Json` payload. Gas is charged by
  schema bytes, source bytes, words, collection elements, and encoded bytes.
- `JSON_SET_I64`, `JSON_SET_ACCOUNT_ID`, and their direct variants — Gas: `G_json + bytes`.
- SMARTCONTRACT_EXECUTE_QUERY charges base + per-item + per-byte; sorting multiplies per-item cost. Pagination offsets add an extra per-item penalty for unsorted queries; for sorted queries, the per-item charge is based on all items scanned before pagination (so offsets are already included). Query materialization aborts with OutOfGas when the per-item budget is exhausted, and responses that exceed the per-byte budget are rejected before encoding when exact Norito sizing is available (otherwise after encoding).

- 0xE0 INPUT_PUBLISH_TLV — Args: `r10=&Blob(TLV)` → Return: `ptr (r10)` — Gas: G_input_publish + bytes (rejects invalid TLV envelopes and disallowed pointer types)
- 0x90 SM3_HASH — Args: `r10=&Blob(message)` → Return: `ptr (&Blob(digest))` — Gas: G_hash + bytes
- 0x91 SM2_VERIFY — Args: `r10=&Blob(msg)`, `r11=&Blob(sig)` (64-byte r∥s), `r12=&Blob(pubkey)` (SEC1), `r13=&Blob(distid)` *(optional, 0 for default)* → Return: `u64=0/1` — Gas: G_verify + bytes
- 0x92 SM4_GCM_SEAL — Args: `r10=&Blob(key16)`, `r11=&Blob(nonce12)`, `r12=&Blob(aad)` *(0 => empty)*, `r13=&Blob(plaintext)` → Return: `ptr (&Blob(ciphertext || tag16))` — Gas: G_sm4 + bytes
- 0x93 SM4_GCM_OPEN — Args: `r10=&Blob(key16)`, `r11=&Blob(nonce12)`, `r12=&Blob(aad)` *(0 => empty)*, `r13=&Blob(ciphertext || tag16)` → Return: `ptr (&Blob(plaintext))` or `0` on failure — Gas: G_sm4 + bytes
- 0x94 SM4_CCM_SEAL — Args: `r10=&Blob(key16)`, `r11=&Blob(nonce[7..13])`, `r12=&Blob(aad)` *(0 => empty)*, `r13=&Blob(plaintext)`, `r14=tag_len:u64` *(0 => 16)* → Return: `ptr (&Blob(ciphertext || tag))` — Gas: G_sm4 + bytes
- 0x95 SM4_CCM_OPEN — Args: `r10=&Blob(key16)`, `r11=&Blob(nonce[7..13])`, `r12=&Blob(aad)` *(0 => empty)*, `r13=&Blob(ciphertext || tag)`, `r14=tag_len:u64` *(0 => 16)* → Return: `ptr (&Blob(plaintext))` or `0` on failure — Gas: G_sm4 + bytes
- 0x96 SHA256_HASH, 0x97 SHA3_HASH, 0x98 BLAKE2B256_HASH, 0x99 KECCAK256_HASH, and 0x9A IROHA_HASH all take `r10=&Blob(message)` and return `r10=ptr (&Blob(digest))`. They use fixed CPU implementations or byte-equivalent acceleration only, so the returned digest is byte-identical across machines. Gas: G_hash + bytes.
- 0xF0 ALLOC — Args: `r10=bytes:u64` → Return: `ptr (r10)` — Gas: G_alloc + bytes
- 0xF1 GET_PUBLIC_INPUT — Args: `r10=&Name` → Return: `ptr (&Tlv)` — Gas: G_get_pub + bytes
  - Reads a public input by name from the on-chain registry `Parameters.custom["ivm_public_inputs"]`.
  - Registry entries are JSON objects: `{ "name": "<Name>", "type_id": <u16>, "tlv_hex": "<hex>" }` with optional `gas_base`/`gas_per_byte` (`tlv_hex` is the full TLV envelope; `0x` prefix allowed).
  - Missing names return `PermissionDenied`; malformed name TLVs or ABI-disallowed types raise syscall errors. Invalid registry entries are skipped during host hydration.
- 0xF8 PRIVATE_NUMERIC_VALCOM — Args: `r10=private typed numeric TLV`, `r11=private typed numeric TLV` → Return: `r10=public int TLV containing the complete compressed Pedersen point` — Gas: G_private_numeric_valcom
  - Each complete typed numeric TLV is projected with its nominal kind and ABI
    domains. The resulting 256-bit digest is reduced modulo the BLS12-381
    scalar order by exactly two unconditional constant-time
    conditional-subtract rounds; the path contains no secret-dependent
    division, loop, branch, or `u64` truncation.
  - The independent BLS12-381 G1 blinding generator is the ABI-bound compressed
    point `892a15529e5d0a920b4765f578519d79a193903553c1e6676a3cc9b8c89fc1970cba9e5f648bdfd7440dd7d9efb62e26`.
    Runtime decodes this fixed subgroup point; a release test requires it to
    equal `hash_to_curve("KOTODAMA_PRIVATE_NUMERIC_VALCOM_H_V1", DST, [])`.
- 0xFD GET_PRIVATE_INPUT — Args: `r10=index:u64`, `r11=kind (int=0, decimal=1, quantity=2)` → Return: `r10=opaque private typed numeric TLV` — Gas: G_get_priv
  - Available only to local/prover/test hosts. Ordinary production consensus
    dispatch rejects every seiyaku selector with a reachable
    `GET_PRIVATE_INPUT`, including helper-hidden calls.
  - Consensus `CoreHost` also returns `PermissionDenied` from quote preparation
    and direct execution, independently of selector resolution. It never
    forwards this syscall to the local/prover `DefaultHost` transport.
  - Raw witness bytes must never enter signed transactions, `IvmProved`
    payloads, overlays, public argument records, or deterministic validator
    replay. The gate can be removed only when the proof statement binds the
    seiyaku address and code hash, selector, public arguments, authority and
    chain, state root and exact read/write sets, outputs and events, gas
    schedule and ceiling, and circuit and verifier-key versions.
- 0xFE COMMIT_OUTPUT — Args: none → Return: `u64=0` — Gas: G_commit

The retired `0xFB USE_NULLIFIER` number is not in ABI V1. Deployable bytecode
that contains it is rejected as `UnknownSyscall`; its invocation-local `u64`
set was neither full-width nor durable across transactions.

For the SM4 calls, the host appends the authentication tag to the ciphertext output; callers supply the same layout when invoking the corresponding `OPEN` syscall. `SM4_GCM_*` always uses a 16-byte tag and 12-byte nonce. `SM4_CCM_*` accepts nonce lengths between 7 and 13 bytes and tag sizes {4,6,8,10,12,14,16}; pass the desired tag length in `r14` (use `0` to select 16). Passing `0` in `r12` denotes an empty AAD. Gas charges a fixed SM4 base plus AAD bytes and plaintext/ciphertext bytes inspected, including validation-failure paths after pointer decoding.

Kotodama intrinsics
- ``sm::hash(msg: Blob) -> Blob`` mirrors `msg` into INPUT with `INPUT_PUBLISH_TLV` and issues `SM3_HASH`, returning a pointer to the digest Blob.
- ``sm::verify(msg: Blob, sig: Blob, pk: Blob[, distid: Blob]) -> bool`` mirrors each Blob argument into INPUT, invokes `SM2_VERIFY`, and returns `true` for valid signatures. Omitting the fourth argument selects the runtime-configured default (``Sm2PublicKey::default_distid()``, sourced from `crypto.sm2_distid_default`); providing it enforces a custom distinguishing identifier.
- ``current_time_ms() -> int`` issues `CURRENT_TIME_MS` and returns the deterministic logical execution time in milliseconds. `CoreHost` binds transaction contract calls to the signed transaction creation time and trigger calls to the block-header creation time; test/default hosts use an explicitly configured value and default to `0`. No host reads wall-clock time while servicing the syscall.
- ``block_height() -> int`` issues `SYSVAR_BLOCK_HEIGHT` and returns the host-provided committed block height. `CoreHost` binds this to the attached transaction context; test/default hosts default to `0`.

Exact numeric helpers
- `0x010100..0x010113` implement signed checked and explicit modulo-`2^512`
  `int` operations; `0x010120..0x01012F` implement exact `decimal` operations;
  and `0x010140..0x01014F` implement nominal non-negative `quantity`
  operations. The generated table below is the signature source of truth.
- Numeric operands are schema-bound, uncompressed Norito frames in pointer
  types `Quantity=0x0010`, `Int=0x0011`, and `Decimal=0x0012`. Pointer ID
  `0x0013` is unassigned and rejected as unknown.
- The domain is `-2^511..=2^511-1`; decimal and quantity scale is `0..=28`.
  Exact division distinguishes division by zero, repeating expansion, and a
  terminating result whose minimum scale exceeds 28. Rounded operations name
  exactly one of `toward_zero` (tag 0), `away_from_zero` (tag 1), `floor`
  (tag 2), `ceil` (tag 3), `nearest_even` (tag 4), `nearest_away` (tag 5), or
  `nearest_toward_zero` (tag 6).
- Numeric syscalls use Gas: `G_numeric_staged`
  (`asset:gas/G_numeric_staged@ivm.core/v2`) and quote-free staged gas:
  `384 + input_envelope_bytes + input_hash_frame_bytes + output_envelope_bytes
  + 2 * output_frame_bytes + 4 * logical_limb_work` (formula version 5).
  The entry weight covers dispatch, staged bookkeeping, and at most four
  bounded control-register checks. Each logical base-`2^64` work cell receives
  four units for operand access, arithmetic/carry or quotient trial, result
  access, and deterministic loop control; multiplication and division formulas
  enumerate every cell they perform. `cargo bench -p ivm --bench
  gas_calibration` pins work denominators for 1..=8 input limbs, 10-limb scale
  alignment, 16-limb products, and minimum/maximum authenticated envelope
  snapshot/publication pipelines. Release calibration requires a 25% safety
  margin on every supported baseline tier; failure changes the gas formula
  version/hash rather than selecting hardware-dependent semantics.

Native JSON construction
- 0x01004E `JSON_BUILD` takes
  `r10=&NoritoBytes(JsonConstructionSchemaV1)`, `r11=aligned word table`, and
  `r12=exact word count`, returning `r10=&Json`.
- Native construction uses Gas: `G_json_build`; typed getters use Gas: `G_json_get`.
- Object keys are canonicalized by lexical key order, duplicate keys and
  malformed schemas are rejected, and nested `Option`/`List` handles are read
  recursively. Booleans remain JSON primitives; `int` renders as a JSON number
  token across the complete `i64`/`u64` domain, while `decimal` and `quantity`
  remain canonical base-10 strings and bytes are lowercase `0x` hex. No
  floating-point conversion occurs.
- Products, `Result`, and resource handles are not accepted as implicit JSON
  values. Typed getters materialize active payloads only. The exact numeric
  int getters at `0x010160` and `0x010163` accept only `i64`/`u64` JSON number
  tokens. Decimal and quantity getters at `0x010161..0x010162` and
  `0x010164..0x010165` accept canonical strings only. Numeric strings for int,
  floating-point number tokens, and alternate spellings return `Option::none`.

Domains / Peers
- 0x10 REGISTER_DOMAIN — Args: `r10=&DomainId` → 0 — Gas: G_reg_domain
- 0x11 UNREGISTER_DOMAIN — Args: `r10=&DomainId` → 0 — Gas: G_unreg_domain
- 0x12 TRANSFER_DOMAIN — Args: `r10=&DomainId, r11=&AccountId(to)` → 0 — Gas: G_transfer_domain
- 0x15 REGISTER_PEER — Args: `r10=&Json` (RegisterPeerWithPop) → 0 — Gas: G_reg_peer
  - JSON object: `{ "peer": "<public_key or public_key@addr>", "pop": [..], "activation_at": <u64?>, "expiry_at": <u64?>, "hsm": <HsmBinding?> }`
  - `peer` may be a string or an object with `public_key`/`publicKey`/`peer_id`/`peerId`/`key`; those keys are also accepted at top level.
- 0x16 UNREGISTER_PEER — Args: `r10=&Json` (peer id string or object with `peer`/`peer_id`/`peerId`/`public_key`/`publicKey`/`key`) → 0 — Gas: G_unreg_peer

Accounts
- 0x13 REGISTER_ACCOUNT — Args: `r10=&AccountId` → 0 — Gas: G_reg_acct
- 0x14 UNREGISTER_ACCOUNT — Args: `r10=&AccountId` → 0 — Gas: G_unreg_acct
- 0x17 ADD_SIGNATORY — Args: `r10=&AccountId, r11=&Json` (pubkey string or object with `public_key`/`publicKey`/`key`) → 0 — Gas: G_add_sig
- 0x18 REMOVE_SIGNATORY — Args: `r10=&AccountId, r11=&Json` (pubkey string or object with `public_key`/`publicKey`/`key`) → 0 — Gas: G_rm_sig
- 0x19 SET_ACCOUNT_QUORUM — Args: `r10=&AccountId, r11=quorum:u64` → 0 — Gas: G_set_quorum
- 0x1A SET_ACCOUNT_DETAIL — Args: `r10=&AccountId, r11=&Name, r12=&Json` → 0 — Gas: G_set_detail + bytes(val)

Notes:
- Signatory/quorum syscalls update the multisig spec stored in account metadata key `multisig/spec`.
  The target account is selected by canonical `AccountId`; signatory accounts must exist and the
  resulting spec must remain acyclic with quorum reachable.
- These syscalls update multisig roles and metadata and rekey the account controller to the
  canonical multisig id derived from the spec (signatories must be single-key accounts).

Assets (FT)
- 0x20 REGISTER_ASSET — Args: `r10=&AssetDefinitionId` → 0 — Gas: G_reg_asset
- 0x21 UNREGISTER_ASSET — Args: `r10=&AssetDefinitionId` → 0 — Gas: G_unreg_asset
- 0x22 MINT_ASSET — Args: `r10=&AccountId, r11=&AssetDefinitionId, r12=&Quantity` → 0 — Gas: G_mint
- 0x23 BURN_ASSET — Args: `r10=&AccountId, r11=&AssetDefinitionId, r12=&Quantity` → 0 — Gas: G_burn
- 0x24 TRANSFER_V1 — Args: `r10=&AccountId(from), r11=&AccountId(to), r12=&AssetDefinitionId, r13=&Quantity` → 0 — Gas: G_transfer. Batch-internal only; rejected outside an active FASTPQ batch.

NFTs
- 0x25 NFT_MINT_ASSET — Args: `r10=&NftId, r11=&AccountId(owner)` → 0 — Gas: G_nft_mint_asset
- 0x26 NFT_TRANSFER_ASSET — Args: `r10=&AccountId(from), r11=&NftId, r12=&AccountId(to)` → 0 — Gas: G_nft_transfer_asset

- 0x28 NFT_BURN_ASSET — Args: `r10=&NftId` → 0 — Gas: G_nft_burn_asset
- 0x2C TRANSFER_ASSET_SCOPED — Args: `r10=&AccountId(from), r11=&AccountId(to), r12=&AssetDefinitionId, r13=&Quantity, r14=&DataSpaceId` → 0 — Gas: G_transfer. Queues a transfer using the asset definition's balance-scope policy: global definitions use a global source balance, and dataspace-restricted definitions use `Dataspace(r14)`.

Zero‑knowledge (verification/state‑read)
- 0x60 ZK_VOTE_VERIFY_BALLOT — Args: `r10=&NoritoBytes(iroha_data_model::zk::OpenVerifyEnvelope)` → `u64=0/1` — Gas: G_verify_proof + bytes
- 0x61 ZK_VOTE_VERIFY_TALLY — Args: `r10=&NoritoBytes(iroha_data_model::zk::OpenVerifyEnvelope)` → `u64=0/1` — Gas: G_verify_proof + bytes
- 0x62 ZK_ROOTS_GET — Args: `r10=&NoritoBytes(RootsGetRequest)` → `ptr (NoritoBytes(RootsGetResponse))` — Gas: G_roots_get + bytes
- 0x63 ZK_VOTE_GET_TALLY — Args: `r10=&NoritoBytes(VoteGetTallyRequest)` → `ptr (NoritoBytes(VoteGetTallyResponse))` — Gas: G_vote_get + bytes

ZK gating & determinism
- `CoreHost` performs full proof verification through the configured backend verifier (`iroha_core::zk::verify_backend_with_timing`), not the legacy polynomial-opening helper.
- `DefaultHost` has no verifier-key registry or cryptographic backend. It
  canonical-validates `iroha_data_model::zk::OpenVerifyEnvelope`, enforces
  configured size/batch gates, and then fails closed with `ERR_BACKEND`.
  Batch responses contain one zero byte per item (`1 = verified`, `0 = not
  verified`), set `r11=ERR_BACKEND`, and set `r12=0` for the first failed item.
- `CoreHost` additionally binds each envelope to the on-chain VK registry
  before verification; batch items then run through
  `iroha_core::zk::verify_backend_with_timing_guardrails`.
- Verification is bound to the VK registry before cryptographic checks:
  - envelope/backend must be supported (`backend = halo2-ipa-pasta`), `vk_hash` must be present, and payload/proof sizes must respect config caps.
  - the referenced verifying key must be active and match circuit id, schema hash (`hash(public_inputs)`), namespace, and owner manifest.
  - configured curve/max_k policy is enforced from VK metadata / VK envelope parameters.
- Return conventions:
  - `r10=1`, `r11=0` on success.
  - `r10=0`, `r11=<ERR_*>` on precheck/binding failure (`ERR_DISABLED`, `ERR_BACKEND`, `ERR_CURVE`, `ERR_K`, `ERR_DECODE`, `ERR_VERIFY`, `ERR_ENVELOPE_SIZE`, `ERR_PROOF_LEN`, `ERR_VK_MISSING`, `ERR_VK_MISMATCH`, `ERR_VK_INACTIVE`, `ERR_NAMESPACE`).
- `ERR_DISABLED` is returned only when the configured verifier is disabled.

Roles / Permissions
- 0x30 CREATE_ROLE — Args: `r10=&Name, r11=&Json` (perm set) → 0 — Gas: G_create_role
  - Permissions JSON: array of permission strings/objects or `{ "permissions": [...] }` / `{ "perms": [...] }`.
- 0x31 DELETE_ROLE — Args: `r10=&Name` → 0 — Gas: G_delete_role
- 0x32 GRANT_ROLE — Args: `r10=&AccountId, r11=&Name` → 0 — Gas: G_grant_role
- 0x33 REVOKE_ROLE — Args: `r10=&AccountId, r11=&Name` → 0 — Gas: G_revoke_role
- 0x34 GRANT_PERMISSION — Args: `r10=&AccountId, r11=&Name|&Json(Permission)` → 0 — Gas: G_grant_perm
- 0x35 REVOKE_PERMISSION — Args: `r10=&AccountId, r11=&Name|&Json(Permission)` → 0 — Gas: G_revoke_perm

Triggers
- 0x40 CREATE_TRIGGER — Args: `r10=&Json` (trigger spec) → 0 — Gas: G_create_trig
  - Spec payloads:
    - JSON string: base64 Norito-encoded `Trigger` (canonical).
    - JSON object: `{ "id": "<trigger_id>", "action": <ActionSpec> }` where `action` is either a
      base64 Norito `Action` string or a JSON object with `executable`, `repeats`, `authority`,
      `filter`, and `metadata` fields (matching `SpecializedAction<EventFilterBox>`).
    - `EventFilterBox::TriggerCompleted` filters are rejected for triggering actions.
- 0x41 REMOVE_TRIGGER — Args: `r10=&Name` → 0 — Gas: G_remove_trig
- 0x42 SET_TRIGGER_ENABLED — Args: `r10=&Name, r11=enabled:u64` → 0 — Gas: G_set_trig
  - Writes trigger metadata key `__enabled` to `true`/`false`; missing key defaults to enabled.
- 0x43 DEACTIVATE_CONTRACT_INSTANCE — Args: `r10=&NoritoBytes(DeactivateContractInstance)` → 0 — Gas: G_contract_admin + bytes
- 0x44 REMOVE_SMART_CONTRACT_BYTES — Args: `r10=&NoritoBytes(RemoveSmartContractBytes)` → 0 — Gas: G_contract_admin + bytes
- 0x45 REGISTER_SMART_CONTRACT_CODE — Args: `r10=&NoritoBytes(RegisterSmartContractCode)` → 0 — Gas: G_contract_admin + bytes
- 0x46 REGISTER_SMART_CONTRACT_BYTES — Args: `r10=&NoritoBytes(RegisterSmartContractBytes)` → 0 — Gas: G_contract_admin + bytes
- 0x47 ACTIVATE_CONTRACT_INSTANCE — Args: `r10=&NoritoBytes(ActivateContractInstance)` → 0 — Gas: G_contract_admin + bytes

Lifecycle operations expect canonical Norito encodings of the corresponding ISI structs. Hosts
trim empty `reason` strings for `DeactivateContractInstance`/`RemoveSmartContractBytes` and
enforce governance permissions before queuing the instruction.

Durable state
- 0x50 STATE_GET — Args: `r10=&NoritoBytes(StatePath)` → `ptr (&NoritoBytes)` or `0` — Gas: G_state_get + bytes
- 0x51 STATE_SET — Args: `r10=&NoritoBytes(StatePath), r11=&NoritoBytes(value)` → 0 — Gas: G_state_set + bytes
- 0x52 STATE_DEL — Args: `r10=&NoritoBytes(StatePath)` → 0 — Gas: G_state_del
- State paths are a distinct nominal storage-path type transported inside
  `NoritoBytes`; a `Name` TLV is not an alternate path carrier.
- Deployed-contract execution scopes every path to `sc/<contract-address-hash>/`.
  Scoped operations never read, enumerate, overwrite, or delete unscoped keys.
  Generic programs have no authenticated contract namespace, so every durable
  state syscall is rejected during admission and again before host dispatch.
- State gas is deterministic and byte-counted: present reads and writes charge
  the `NoritoBytes` payload length, misses and tombstones charge only the fixed
  base, and key enumeration adds the returned-key count plus encoded result
  bytes.

Smart‑contract helpers (Norito)
- 0xA0 EXECUTE_INSTRUCTION — Args: `r10=&NoritoBytes(InstructionBox)`, `r11=operation_tag` (`1=SubmitBallot`, `2=RecordSccpMessage`) → 0 — Gas: G_sci
- 0xA5 SUBSCRIPTION_BILL — Args: none → 0 — Gas: G_sub_bill
  - Uses trigger metadata `subscription_ref` to locate the subscription NFT, computes charges, updates subscription metadata (including `subscription_invoice`), and reschedules the billing trigger.
- 0xA6 SUBSCRIPTION_RECORD_USAGE — Args: none → 0 — Gas: G_sub_usage
  - Parses `SubscriptionUsageDelta` from trigger args, increments usage counters, and updates subscription metadata.
- 0xA9 CALL_CONTRACT — Args: `r10=&Blob(contract_address), r11=&Blob(entrypoint), r12=&NoritoBytes(EntrypointArgumentRecordV1) or 0` → `r10=ptr (&NoritoBytes(EntrypointReturnRecordV1))` or `0` — Gas: G_call_contract + request bytes + return bytes + child gas
  - Executes the callee in a child VM. The parent escrows the available syscall gas and is charged the fixed request/return overhead plus all gas consumed by child instructions and child syscalls; unused escrow is refunded.
  - If the callee source declares `authorize("PermissionName")`, its manifest carries that caller-authorization requirement. The host checks the caller contract subject for the named direct or role-derived permission before launching the child VM; missing permission rejects the syscall with `PermissionDenied`.

Extended query/sysvar surface (`SYSTEM` / SCALLX)
- 0x010000 QUERY_EXECUTE_NORITO — Args: `r10=&NoritoBytes(QueryRequest)` → `ptr (&NoritoBytes(QueryResponse))` — Gas: G_scq
- 0x010001 CORE_QUERY_GET — Args: `r10=CoreQueryEntityTagV1`, `r11=&typed entity id` → `r10=Option<View>` sum handle. The active projection is flattened in declaration order and contains exact typed leaf TLVs.
- 0x010002 CORE_QUERY_PAGE — Args: `r10=CoreQueryEntityTagV1`, `r11=offset:i64 bits`, `r12=limit:1..=64` → `r10=List<View,64>` handle, `r11=Option<int>` sum handle. Pages preserve canonical ID order and expose a next offset only after a one-item lookahead proves another page exists.
- 0x010006..0x010008 retain the canonical-Norito specialist reads for named parameters, contract manifests, and contract instances. Parameter keys are `&Name`, manifest keys are `&NoritoBytes(Hash)`, and instance keys are either `&NoritoBytes(ContractAddress)` or `&Name(alias)`; untyped `NoritoBytes(Name)` carriers are rejected. Core and specialist reads use deterministic item/byte gas schedules.
- `QUERY_GET_PARAMETER` accepts canonical system parameter names such as `block.max_transactions`, `transaction.max_instructions`, `smart_contract.fuel`, `smart_contract.max_output_items`, `smart_contract.max_output_bytes`, and exact custom parameter names.
- 0x010020 SYSVAR_CHAIN_ID — Args: none → `ptr (&Blob(chain_id))` or `0` — Gas: G_sysvar + bytes
- 0x010021 SYSVAR_BLOCK_HEIGHT — Args: none → `u64=height` — Gas: G_sysvar
- 0x010022 SYSVAR_BLOCK_TIME_MS — Args: none → `u64=block_time_ms` — Gas: G_sysvar
- 0x010023 SYSVAR_AUTHORITY — Args: none → `ptr (&AccountId)` — Gas: G_get_auth + bytes
- 0x010024 SYSVAR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS — Args: none → `ptr (&NoritoBytes(ContractAddress))` or `0` — Gas: G_sysvar + bytes
- 0x010025 SYSVAR_ENTRYPOINT — Args: none → `ptr (&Blob(entrypoint))` or `0` — Gas: G_sysvar + bytes
- 0x010026 DECODE_ARGUMENT_RECORD — Args: raw hosts use `r10=&NoritoBytes(EntrypointArgumentRecordV1)`; prepared contract calls use the exact host-issued `&NoritoBytes(domain-separated record binding)`; `r11=&NoritoBytes(EntrypointArgumentSchemaV1)` → `r10=&Blob(pad:u8 then [u64; word_count])` — Gas: G_argument_decode + record + schema + materialized output. Prepared calls first validate the trusted flat schema and derive its conservative maximum aggregate and pointer-allocation bound; that bound must be affordable before the untrusted canonical record is decoded. Raw syscall quoting authenticates neither payload: it uses only bounded record/schema envelope lengths and reserves the full HEAP before schema and record authentication. For prepared calls, the complete signed record remains host-owned and the guest sees only its domain-separated binding. Before any allocation, the host preflights the complete aligned TLV sequence plus raw aggregate storage. Pointer TLVs and the output word table prefer INPUT and spill into owned HEAP, while raw `List` and sum storage is always owned HEAP. The record limit is inclusive at 1 MiB. Raw hosts then validate the schema hash, canonical flat atoms, inactive sum payloads, and every embedded typed pointer. JSON-to-record conversion occurs only at Torii/CLI tooling boundaries.
- 0x010027 SYSVAR_CONTRACT_SUBJECT — Args: none → `ptr (&AccountId(contract subject))` — Gas: G_sysvar + bytes. Calls outside a deployed-contract scope fail closed.
- 0x010028 NORMALIZE_NORITO_BYTES — Args: `r10=&Blob or &NoritoBytes` in validated public memory → `ptr (&NoritoBytes(same payload))` — Gas: G_pointer + bytes
  - Compiler transport helper for strict Norito-consuming syscalls. It rejects null, malformed, disallowed, and non-bytes pointers, then allocates a fresh canonical V1 `NoritoBytes` envelope with an identical payload and recomputed hash. It performs no serialization and does not weaken the receiving syscall's exact pointer-type checks.
- 0x010200 SET_ASSET_TRANSFER_AVAILABILITY — Args: `r10=&AccountId, r11=&AssetDefinitionId, r12=expected_revision:u64, r13=availability_flags:u64 (bit 0 incoming, bit 1 outgoing; reserved bits zero), r14=&Option<String>` → 0 — Gas: G_sci + bytes
- 0x010201 SET_ASSET_TRANSFER_DAILY_LIMIT — Args: `r10=&AccountId, r11=&AssetDefinitionId, r12=&Option<Quantity>` → 0 — Gas: G_sci + bytes
- 0x010202 SET_ASSET_HOLDING_LIMIT — Args: `r10=&AccountId, r11=&AssetDefinitionId, r12=&Option<Quantity>` → 0 — Gas: G_sci + bytes
- 0x010210 ACCOUNT_RECOVERY_PROPOSE — Args: `r10=&Blob(alias), r11=&AccountId(replacement)` → 0 — Gas: G_sci + bytes
- 0x010211 ACCOUNT_RECOVERY_APPROVE — Args: `r10=&Blob(alias)` → 0 — Gas: G_sci + bytes
- 0x010212 ACCOUNT_RECOVERY_CANCEL — Args: `r10=&Blob(alias)` → 0 — Gas: G_sci + bytes
- 0x010213 ACCOUNT_RECOVERY_FINALIZE — Args: `r10=&Blob(alias)` → 0 — Gas: G_sci + bytes
- 0x010030 STATE_KEYS — Args: `r10=&NoritoBytes(StatePath prefix), r11=offset, r12=limit` (`0..=64`, where `0` returns an empty page) → `ptr (&NoritoBytes(Vec<StatePath>))`, `r11=total`, `r12=count` — Gas: G_state_keys + count + bytes
  - Enumerates durable-state keys in canonical sorted order. With CNTR metadata, the prefix must resolve to a declared path; a bare `StateMap` base is accepted here and by `STATE_COUNT`, but rejected by value operations. In contract-runtime scope, internal storage prefixes are stripped before return, and staged tombstones are applied before pagination. The ledger host seeks directly to the scoped ordered prefix and does not materialize unrelated global keys; its `count` gas component conservatively includes every textual-prefix candidate examined across persisted state and the transaction overlay. Limits above 64 are rejected by every host.
- 0x010031 STATE_HAS — Args: `r10=&NoritoBytes(StatePath)` → `r10=present` — Gas: G_state_has
  - Tests durable-state key presence with the same scoped overlay, base-state, and tombstone resolution as `STATE_GET`.
- 0x010032 STATE_LEN — Args: `r10=&NoritoBytes(StatePath)` → `r10=len`, `r11=found` — Gas: G_state_len + bytes
  - Returns the `NoritoBytes` payload length for present values, excluding the TLV envelope. Missing values return `len=0, found=0`.
- 0x010033 STATE_COUNT — Args: `r10=&NoritoBytes(StatePath prefix)` → `r10=total` — Gas: G_state_count + count
  - Counts durable-state keys with the same canonical sorted prefix matching, scope stripping, overlay, and tombstone resolution as `STATE_KEYS`, without cloning or returning the key list. The ledger host charges for every ordered-range candidate examined, including candidates rejected by path-segment matching and overlay tombstones.
- 0x010034 STATE_MAP_KEY_AT — Args: `r10=&NoritoBytes(Vec<StatePath>), r11=&Name(base), r12=index` → `ptr (&NoritoBytes(canonical key))` or `0` — Gas: G_path + bytes
  - Compiler-internal decoder for bounded `StateMap` iteration. It accepts at most 64 paths in a 1 MiB page, requires an exact `base/<lowercase hex>` child, binds the recovered key to the base's CNTR-declared nominal key type, and rejects missing schemas, type confusion, malformed, non-canonical, or over-4-KiB keys.
- 0x010035 STATE_VALUE_ENCODE — Args: `r10=&NoritoBytes(StateValueSchemaV1), r11=&[u64], r12=word_count` → `ptr (&NoritoBytes(StateValueRecordV1))` — Gas: G_state_value + schema + words + pointers + output
  - Compiler-internal encoder for one canonical typed durable value. The schema is validated, active pointer leaves must carry canonical payloads of their declared ABI types, inactive `Option`/`Result` branches must be all-zero/null, and the stored record is bound to the exact schema by a domain-separated hash. A source-level `bytes` leaf may arrive transiently as `Blob` or `NoritoBytes`; the encoder copies its payload into the single canonical persisted `Blob` envelope. Stored records using `NoritoBytes` for that leaf remain invalid.
- 0x010036 STATE_VALUE_DECODE — Args: `r10=&NoritoBytes(StateValueSchemaV1), r11=&NoritoBytes(StateValueRecordV1)` → `ptr (&Blob(pad:u8 then [u64; word_count]))` — Gas: G_state_value + schema + record + pointers + output
  - Compiler-internal decoder for scalars, structs, tuples, `Option`, and `Result`. Missing map entries are handled by the caller's outer `Option`; a zero record pointer, non-canonical inactive branch, malformed typed leaf, or different schema hash is rejected.
- 0x010037 STATE_PATH_FROM_NAME — Args: `r10=&Name` → `ptr (&NoritoBytes(StatePath))` — Gas: G_path + bytes
  - Compiler-internal conversion for durable-state helper parameters. It does
    not make `Name` a valid carrier for any state operation.

Canonical instruction bridge
- `EXECUTE_INSTRUCTION` accepts only a pointer-ABI `NoritoBytes` payload containing the canonical
  Norito frame of one data-model `InstructionBox`. Register `r11` must contain the matching
  operation tag: `1` for `SubmitBallot` or `2` for `RecordSccpMessage`.
- JSON pointers, raw JSON envelopes, direct concrete-instruction frames, alternate-layout Norito
  frames, tag `0`, unknown tags, mismatched instruction types, and all other instruction types are
  rejected. There is no compatibility decoding path.
- 0xA1 EXECUTE_QUERY — Args: `r10=&NoritoBytes(QueryRequest)` → `ptr` — Gas: G_scq
- 0xA2 CREATE_NFTS_FOR_ALL_USERS — Args: none → `u64=count` — Gas: G_create_nfts_all
- 0xA3 SET_SMARTCONTRACT_EXECUTION_DEPTH — Args: `r10=depth:u64` → `u64=prev` — Gas: G_sc_depth
- 0xA4 GET_AUTHORITY — Args: none → host-owned `ptr (&AccountId)` — Gas: G_get_auth
- 0xA7 RESOLVE_ACCOUNT_ALIAS — Args: `r10=&Blob(alias literal)` → host-owned `ptr (&AccountId)` — Gas: G_alias_resolve

AXT host flow
- 0xB0 AXT_BEGIN — Args: `r10=&AxtDescriptor`. Resets any in‑progress envelope and records the descriptor; hosts derive the canonical binding used by capability handles from this descriptor. Gas: G_axt + bytes.
- 0xB1 AXT_TOUCH — Args: `r10=&DataSpaceId`, `r11=&NoritoBytes(TouchManifest)` or `0`. Declares the manifest of keys touched for the dataspace within the current envelope. Gas: G_axt + bytes.
- 0xB2 AXT_COMMIT — Args: none. Validates recorded handles, manifests, and proofs for the active envelope and clears host state on success. Gas: G_axt + entries.
- 0xB3 VERIFY_DS_PROOF — Args: `r10=&DataSpaceId`, `r11=&ProofBlob` (or `0` to clear). Associates dataspace proof material with the active envelope. Gas: G_verify + bytes.
- 0xB4 USE_ASSET_HANDLE — Args: `r10=&AssetHandle`, `r11=&NoritoBytes(RemoteSpendIntent)`, `r12=&ProofBlob` (optional). Validates capability bindings/budgets and records spend intents for later commit checks. Gas: G_axt + bytes.
- Default and WSV hosts enforce descriptor membership, capability binding equality, budget checks, and proof presence before permitting commit.

Native asset escrow
- 0xB8 ESCROW_OPEN_OFFER — Args: `r10=&Name(escrow)`, `r11=&AssetDefinitionId`, `r12=&Quantity`, `r13=&NoritoBytes(Vec<Hash>)` or `0` → 0. Gas: G_escrow + bytes. Queues `OpenAssetEscrow`; the seller authority locks funds into the deterministic protocol custody account.
- 0xB9 ESCROW_ACCEPT — Args: `r10=&Name(escrow)` → 0. Gas: G_escrow + bytes. Queues `AcceptAssetEscrow` for the buyer authority.
- 0xBA ESCROW_MARK_PAYMENT_SENT — Args: `r10=&Name(escrow)` → 0. Gas: G_escrow + bytes. Queues `MarkEscrowPaymentSent` for the accepted buyer.
- 0xBB ESCROW_RELEASE — Args: `r10=&Name(escrow)` → 0. Gas: G_escrow + bytes. Queues `ReleaseAssetEscrow` for the seller authority after payment is marked.
- 0xBC ESCROW_CANCEL — Args: `r10=&Name(escrow)` → 0. Gas: G_escrow + bytes. Queues `CancelAssetEscrow`; cancellation is rejected once payment is marked.
- 0xBD ESCROW_OPEN_DISPUTE — Args: `r10=&Name(escrow)`, `r11=&NoritoBytes(Vec<Hash>)` or `0` → 0. Gas: G_escrow + bytes. Queues `OpenEscrowDispute` for the seller or accepted buyer.
- 0xBE ESCROW_RESOLVE_DISPUTE — Args: `r10=&Name(escrow)`, `r11=&Quantity(buyer_amount)`, `r12=&Quantity(seller_amount)`, `r13=&NoritoBytes(Vec<Hash>)` or `0` → 0. Gas: G_escrow + bytes. Queues `ResolveEscrowDispute`; core enforces `CanResolveEscrowDispute` and that the split sums to the held amount.
- IDs `0xAA` through `0xAF` and `0xBF` are unassigned holes and must report `UnknownSyscall`.
- Kotodama escrow names are deterministically mapped to `EscrowId`; native ISIs perform custody movement directly and `TRANSFER_ASSET_SCOPED` resolves the source balance scope from the asset definition policy, using `r14` only for dataspace-restricted definitions.

Soracloud runtime host surface
- 0xC0 SORACLOUD_READ_COMMITTED_STATE — Args: `r10=&SoracloudRequest(ReadCommittedState)` → `r10=&SoracloudResponse(ReadCommittedState)`. Returns committed service-state metadata for one declared binding/key pair.
- 0xC1 SORACLOUD_EMIT_STATE_MUTATION — Args: `r10=&SoracloudRequest(EmitStateMutation)` → `r10=&SoracloudResponse(EmitStateMutation)`. Stages a deterministic write-back validated again by core before persistence.
- 0xC2 SORACLOUD_EMIT_MAILBOX_MESSAGE — Args: `r10=&SoracloudRequest(EmitMailboxMessage)` → `r10=&SoracloudResponse(EmitMailboxMessage)`. Emits an outbound mailbox message for authoritative queueing after receipt validation.
- 0xC3 SORACLOUD_APPEND_JOURNAL — Args: `r10=&SoracloudRequest(AppendJournal)` → `r10=&SoracloudResponse(AppendJournal)`. Stages deterministic journal material and returns its content hash.
- 0xC4 SORACLOUD_PUBLISH_CHECKPOINT — Args: `r10=&SoracloudRequest(PublishCheckpoint)` → `r10=&SoracloudResponse(PublishCheckpoint)`. Stages checkpoint material and returns its content hash.
- 0xC5 SORACLOUD_READ_SECRET — Args: `r10=&SoracloudRequest(ReadSecret)` → `r10=&SoracloudResponse(ReadSecret)`. Reads node-local secret material and is only valid from `private_update`.
- 0xC6 SORACLOUD_READ_CREDENTIAL — Args: `r10=&SoracloudRequest(ReadCredential)` → `r10=&SoracloudResponse(ReadCredential)`. Reads node-local credential material and is only valid from `private_update`.
- 0xC7 SORACLOUD_EGRESS_FETCH — Args: `r10=&SoracloudRequest(EgressFetch)` → `r10=&SoracloudResponse(EgressFetch)`. Performs a bounded host-allowlisted fetch and fails deterministically on policy or hash mismatch.
- 0xC8 SORACLOUD_READ_CONFIG — Args: `r10=&SoracloudRequest(ReadConfig)` → `r10=&SoracloudResponse(ReadConfig)`. Reads authoritative service config payload bytes for the active revision and is valid from ordinary Soracloud handlers.
- 0xC9 SORACLOUD_READ_SECRET_ENVELOPE — Args: `r10=&SoracloudRequest(ReadSecretEnvelope)` → `r10=&SoracloudResponse(ReadSecretEnvelope)`. Reads the authoritative committed secret envelope for the active revision and is valid from ordinary Soracloud handlers; raw payload-byte reads remain on the restricted `READ_SECRET` path.
- All Soracloud payloads are Norito request/response envelopes carried in the Soracloud pointer-ABI types. Gas: G_soracloud + request bytes + response bytes. Host failures must be deterministic and receipt-stable, and unknown numbers still map to `VMError::UnknownSyscall`.
- Dedicated Soracloud handler execution uses `irohad`'s `SoracloudIvmHost` to
  produce response envelopes and stage deterministic runtime side effects.
  Ordinary contract execution through `CoreHostImpl` is fail-closed for these
  numbers: it validates the `SoracloudRequest` pointer type, schema version,
  syscall operation, and payload variant, then returns metered
  `VMError::NotImplemented` with `G_soracloud + request bytes` and queues no
  ISI. Wrong pointer types or operation/payload mismatches fail during request
  validation.

ZK Helpers
- 0xF9 GET_ACCOUNT_BALANCE — Args: `r10=&AccountId, r11=&AssetDefinitionId` → `ptr (&Quantity)` — Gas: G_get_bal
- 0xFC VERIFY_SIGNATURE — Args: `r10=&Blob(message)`, `r11=&Blob(signature)`, `r12=&Blob(pubkey)`, `r13=scheme:u8` → `r10=0/1` — Gas: G_verify_sig + bytes

Hardware / Proofs
- 0xF4 PROVE_EXECUTION — Args: none → `r10=&NoritoBytes(ExecutionProof), r11=status:u64` — Gas: G_prove
  - Returns a deterministic execution-proof summary containing fixed fields plus SHA-256 commitments to the VM's PC, delta-register, ZK trace, constraint, memory, register, and step-root logs. This is a byte-stable proof artifact for first-release contracts and tooling; full SNARK/STARK proving can bind to these commitments without changing VM output across hardware.
- 0xF5 GROW_HEAP — Args: `r10=bytes:u64` → `u64=new_limit` — Gas: G_grow_heap per page. Growth fails with `OutOfMemory` when it would exceed the host-installed per-runtime heap ceiling.
- 0xF6 VERIFY_PROOF — Args: `r10=&NoritoBytes(OpenVerifyEnvelope)` → `r10=0/1, r11=status:u64` — Gas: G_verify_proof + bytes
  - `CoreHost` verifies the envelope against the on-chain verifying-key registry with the same deterministic guardrails used by the typed ZK verifier syscalls. The standalone host still returns `NotImplemented` because it has no registry or backend policy context.
- 0xF7 GET_MERKLE_PATH — Args: `r10=addr:u64, r11=out_ptr:u64, r12=root_out:u64?` → `u64=len` — Gas: G_mpath + path_len
  - Writes the authentication path (leaf→root) to `out_ptr`. If `r12 != 0`, also writes the 32‑byte Merkle root to `root_out`.
- 0xFA GET_MERKLE_COMPACT — Args: `r10=addr:u64, r11=out_ptr:u64, r12=depth_cap:u64?, r13=root_out:u64?` → `u64=depth` — Gas: G_mpath + depth
  - Writes a compact proof to `out_ptr` using the layout `[u8 depth][u32 dirs_le][u32 count][count*32 siblings]` with siblings ordered leaf→root.
  - `dirs` encodes, for each level i, whether the running accumulator was the left (0) or right (1) child. Missing siblings are encoded as a 32‑byte zero array (promotion).
  - Caps the depth to `min(depth_cap, 32)` if `r12 != 0`, otherwise uses full path depth up to 32. If `r13 != 0`, writes the 32‑byte Merkle root at `root_out`.
- 0xFF GET_REGISTER_MERKLE_COMPACT — Args: `r10=reg_index:u64, r11=out_ptr:u64, r12=depth_cap:u64?, r13=root_out:u64?` → `u64=depth` — Gas: G_mpath + depth
  - Writes a compact proof for the register commitment using the same layout as GET_MERKLE_COMPACT.

VRF
- 0x66 VRF_VERIFY — Args: `r10=&NoritoBytes(VrfVerifyRequest{variant:u8, pk:bytes, proof:bytes, chain_id:bytes, input:bytes})`, canonical frame at most 65,536 bytes → Return: `r10=ptr (&Blob(32-byte output))`, `r11=status:u64` — Gas: `64 + 250,000 × examined_items + 5 × canonical_request_bytes`
  - Status codes: `0=ok`, `1=type_mismatch`, `2=decode_error`, `3=unknown_variant`, `4=bad_pk`, `5=bad_proof`, `6=verify_fail`, `8=missing_or_mismatched_host_chain`.
  - Canonical-decode failures examine zero items. Every decoded request whose chain, variant, key, proof, or pairing validation begins examines one item. Output encoding/allocation failures trap after charging that item.
  - The host must provide its chain identity. An absent host chain or a request claiming a different `chain_id` is rejected with `r11=8`; the guest claim is never used as fallback consensus context.
  - Proof: BLS signature over `Hash("iroha:vrf:v1:input|" || chain_id || "|" || input)` using VRF-specific DSTs:
    - G2 hash: `"BLS12381G2_XMD:SHA-256_SSWU_RO_IROHA_VRF_V1"`
    - G1 hash: `"BLS12381G1_XMD:SHA-256_SSWU_RO_IROHA_VRF_V1"`
    - Output: `Hash("iroha:vrf:v1:output" || canonical_proof_bytes)`.
  - Encodings: pk and proof MUST be canonical compressed encodings; infinity/non-subgroup are rejected.
  - Variants: `1 = SigInG2 (pk=G1 48B, proof=G2 96B)`, `2 = SigInG1 (pk=G2 96B, proof=G1 48B)`.
  - Both VRF verification syscalls decode with the shared V1 resource budget: at most 65,536 elements in any sequence and cumulatively, at most 65,536 bytes in one field, at most 524,288 cumulative allocated bytes, and nesting depth at most 16.

- 0x67 VRF_VERIFY_BATCH — Args: `r10=&NoritoBytes(VrfVerifyBatchRequest{items: [VrfVerifyRequest]})`, 1 through 16 items, canonical frame at most 65,536 bytes → Return: `r10=ptr (&NoritoBytes(Vec<[u8;32]>))`, `r11=status:u64`, `r12=fail_index?:u64` — Gas: `64 + 250,000 × examined_items + 5 × canonical_request_bytes`
  - Verifies each item; on success returns a Norito-encoded vector of 32‑byte outputs (order preserved). On failure, returns `r10=0`, `r11` = error code, `r12` = index (0‑based) of the first failing item.
  - Empty and over-16 batches fail with `r11=9 (batch_bound)` and `r12=u64::MAX` before backend or response-allocation work. Canonical-decode and batch-bound failures examine zero items. The VM reserves 16 items, then deterministically refunds every unexamined item, including the tail after the first failing item.
  - The host must provide its chain identity and every item must match it. An absent host chain or mismatch fails with `r11=8` and `r12` set to the first affected index.

- 0x7E VRF_EPOCH_SEED — Args: `r10=&NoritoBytes(VrfEpochSeedRequest{epoch:u64, fallback_to_latest:bool})` → Return: `r10=ptr (&NoritoBytes(VrfEpochSeedResponse{found:bool, epoch:u64, seed:[u8;32]}))`, `r11=status:u64` — Gas: G_vote_get + bytes
  - Reads a world-snapshot VRF epoch seed for governance/sortition use in smart contracts.
  - If `fallback_to_latest=true` and the requested epoch is missing, the host returns the latest known epoch seed.
  - Status codes: `0=ok`, `1=type_mismatch`, `2=decode_error`, `3=oom`.

Host gating & chain binding
- A host-owned `chain_id` is mandatory for VRF verification. Missing host
  context and guest/host mismatches both fail closed:
  - Single: `r11=8` and `r10=0`.
  - Batch: `r11=8`, `r12` set to the first affected index, and `r10=0`.
- Output derivation uses domain separation and canonical encodings as described above; outputs are deterministic across hardware.

Notes
- All calls execute via `CoreHost` and are subject to permission checks and invariants identical to built‑in ISIs.
- Gas names reference entries in the generated gas table for the active bytecode header version.

## ABI Stability (ABI v1)

This is the first release, so the ABI surface is still allowed to change before
release cut. The shipped runtime still has exactly one policy, ABI v1, and every
node enforces that policy unconditionally.

- `ProgramMetadata.abi_version` must be `1`; other values are rejected at admission.
- Runtime upgrade manifests must keep `abi_version = 1`; there is no V2 policy yet.
- ABI goldens (syscall list, ABI hash, pointer type IDs) are pinned to the current
  v1 surface and must be updated in the same change whenever the first-release
  surface intentionally changes.
- Pointer provenance tests pin INPUT, allocated HEAP, and exact indexed literals as the only
  accepted V1 object stores. Asset mutation fixtures pin canonical `QuantityValueV1` frames;
  scalar and legacy `NoritoBytes(Numeric)` amount arguments remain invalid.
- Compiler transport normalizes semantic request bytes to `NoritoBytes` before strict VRF
  verification, while typed durable `bytes` values persist only canonical `Blob` atoms.
- Any future post-release ABI break must be delivered through a new policy/version
  with updated tests and docs.

Codec helpers
- 0x53 DECODE_INT — Args: `r10=&NoritoBytes(Norito-framed i64)` → Return: `r10=i64` — Gas: G_numeric + bytes
- 0x55 ENCODE_INT — Args: `r10=value:i64` → Return: `ptr (&NoritoBytes(Norito-framed i64))` — Gas: G_numeric + bytes
- 0x56 BUILD_PATH_KEY_NORITO — Args: `r10=&Name(base), r11=&NoritoBytes(key)` → Return: `ptr (&NoritoBytes(StatePath))` — Gas: G_path + bytes
  - Compiler-internal schema-bound helper. The base must name exactly one CNTR-declared `StateMap`; the key must be the unique canonical encoding of that map's nominal key type. It produces the distinct nominal storage path `base/<lowercase hex of canonical key bytes>`, rejects missing schemas, type confusion, malformed/noncanonical frames, and keys larger than 4 KiB. The exact suffix is reversible and lexicographic path order equals unsigned canonical-byte order.
- 0x57 JSON_ENCODE — Args: `r10=&Json` → Return: `ptr (&NoritoBytes(Json))` — Gas: G_json_encode + bytes
- 0x58 JSON_DECODE — Args: `r10=&NoritoBytes(Json)` → Return: `ptr (&Json)` — Gas: G_json_decode + bytes
- JSON_DECODE rejects already-typed `Json` and raw/framed `Blob` carriers; callers use JSON_ENCODE/JSON_DECODE for the canonical typed conversion pair.
- 0x59 SCHEMA_ENCODE — Args: `r10=&Name(schema), r11=&Json` → Return: `ptr (&NoritoBytes)` — Gas: G_schema + bytes
- 0x5A SCHEMA_DECODE — Args: `r10=&Name(schema), r11=&NoritoBytes(Json)` → Return: `ptr (&Json)` — Gas: G_schema + bytes
- 0x5B SCHEMA_INFO — Args: `r10=&Name(schema)` → Return: `ptr (&Json{"id":...,"version":...})` — Gas: G_schema + bytes
- 0x5F TLV_EQ — Args: `r10=&Tlv, r11=&Tlv` → Return: `r10=1 if equal else 0` — Gas: G_tlv_eq + bytes
  - Compares TLV type, version, and payload bytes exactly. Gas charges the fixed compare base plus the payload bytes inspected.
- 0x77 TLV_LEN — Args: `r10=&Tlv` → Return: `r10=payload_len` — Gas: G_tlv_len + bytes
  - Returns the TLV payload byte length after pointer-ABI validation. Gas charges the fixed length-read base plus the payload bytes inspected.
- 0x5C NAME_DECODE — Args: `r10=&NoritoBytes(Name)` → Return: `ptr (&Name)` — Gas: G_name_decode + bytes
- NAME_DECODE requires the canonical Norito `Name` frame; raw UTF-8, framed `String`, and alternate-layout frames are rejected.
- 0x5D POINTER_TO_NORITO — Args: `r10=&PointerType<T>` → Return: `ptr (&NoritoBytes(TLV envelope))` — Gas: G_pointer + bytes
  - Copies the canonical byte-for-byte pointer-ABI TLV envelope into a NoritoBytes payload. Gas charges the fixed conversion base plus the envelope bytes copied.
- 0x5E POINTER_FROM_NORITO — Args: `r10=&NoritoBytes(TLV envelope), r11=expected?:u16` → Return: `ptr (&PointerType<T>)` — Gas: G_pointer + bytes
- POINTER_FROM_NORITO accepts only the canonical `NoritoBytes` carrier; a `Blob` containing the same inner envelope is a nominal type error.
  - Validates the embedded canonical TLV envelope, optionally checks the expected type id, and rehydrates the pointer. Gas charges the fixed conversion base plus the envelope bytes inspected.
- Null inputs: DECODE_INT, JSON_DECODE, NAME_DECODE, and POINTER_FROM_NORITO accept `r10=0` and return `r10=0` without error.
- All other pointer-typed syscalls require explicit non-zero pointers; there is no implicit last-input fallback.
ZK (Halo2 OpenVerify)
- 0x64 ZK_VERIFY_BATCH — Args: `r10=&NoritoBytes(Vec<iroha_data_model::zk::OpenVerifyEnvelope>)` → Return: `r10=ptr (&NoritoBytes(Vec<u8> statuses))`, `r11=status:u64`, `r12=first_fail_index|u64::MAX` — Gas: configured V1 proof + public-input-unit + encoded request/response byte schedule; 1 MiB encoded-payload and 16-proof hard caps
  - `DefaultHost` has no proof backend. After canonical validation it returns one failure status byte (`0`) per item, `r11=ERR_BACKEND`, and `r12=0`; it never reports a proof as verified.
  - `CoreHost` returns the same status-vector shape and runs the same outer-envelope binding plus full backend verification path as the single-item ZK verify syscalls.
  - Top-level request failures (decode, disabled backend, oversized batch) return `r10=0` and set `r11` (`ERR_DECODE`, `ERR_DISABLED`, `ERR_BACKEND`, `ERR_BATCH`).
  - On vector return, `r11` carries the first observed precheck/verify error code (or `0` when all succeed).

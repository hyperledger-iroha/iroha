//! Sealed bridge between the typed interface and the committed q77 engine.
//!
//! The engine's accepted relation set is closed: only the backend's prepared
//! relation owners implement the private `DeepRelation` marker, and this module
//! is the single place where one of them is viewed as a
//! [`SemanticAir`](super::SemanticAir). The out-of-domain check, run by the
//! verifier and by the producer before it commits its answers, evaluates the
//! relation through that view, and both engine preflights read the relation's
//! declared shape through it, so the interface and the committed engine cannot
//! describe different equations or geometry.
//!
//! [`VerifierLimits`] and [`ProducerLimits`] are the engine's own limit types:
//! bounded verification and the producer's whole-attempt plan take them and
//! nothing else. Each carries one [`WorkLimits`](super::WorkLimits), so the
//! same ceilings a relation is admitted under by the uncommitted reference are
//! the ones the committed engine checks. The public quantity facade maps its
//! policies to them with [`VerifierLimits::for_segment`] and
//! [`ProducerLimits::for_segment`].
//!
//! [`PROFILE`] and [`SEALED_RELATIONS`] expose the engine's fixed geometry and
//! every sealed relation identity as typed data read from the engine's own
//! constants. They describe today's fixed profile; they are not a registry a
//! caller can extend, and proof bytes never select an entry.
//!
//! Process observers registered with [`set_observer`] receive the public
//! progress of committed construction and verification. They cannot change a
//! result.
//!
//! TODO: B.2 moves the remaining direct readers of a sealed relation behind
//! the interface: transcript binding reads the relation's identity and
//! statement from `FixedAir`, the producer's masked quotient uses the prepared
//! evaluator and degree owner of `CompactTransferAir`, and both sides rebuild
//! the public columns with the closed-form `PublicColumnReconstruction`
//! instead of [`SemanticAir::public_value`](super::SemanticAir::public_value).

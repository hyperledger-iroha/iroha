#+TITLE: Iroha 2 test guide
* Why tests are important

Tests are the lifeblood of modern software engineering.  Whenever you
add or remove a feature you /must/ ensure that the tests pass. Sadly,
writing tests is as difficult as writing software, and tests are prone
to misbehaviour. What follows is a short guide on how to write tests,
how to update the tests, and basic troubleshooting.

* Test flakyness

A test is considered flaky if its pass/fail is not deterministic. In
other words, there is no guarantee that it will
always pass or always fail when you run it.

* Known flaky tests

This file should be updated after any performance critical
changes. Note, because most flaky tests are of the =integration=
variety, updating the flakyness report can take upwards of 10 hours
given the minimum of =300= repetitions.

Unfortunately it is impossible to expedite the process,  and doing
something in parallel to the testing can worsen the results,  so
beware of repeating the tests on your work machine.

/// A derive macro for `Identifiable` trait and id-based comparison traits. Currently supports derivations only for
/// `IdBox`, `Event` enums, and structs from the `data_model` crate that don't have generic parameters.
///
/// As such, the macro introduces a new
/// outer attribute `id` for the entities it is derived from. This attribute should
/// be supplied with the associated type to be used in `impl Identifiable`. The type
/// should be supplied as a string literal that constitutes a
/// legal Rust type path.
///
/// As this macro also derives an implementation of `Ord`, `PartialOrd`, `Eq`, `PartialEq` and `Hash` traits that always
/// conforms to the same implementation principles based on ids of the entities.
/// Thus none of the entities that derive this macro should derive neither of the aforementioned traits,
/// as they will be overridden.
///
/// As a rule of thumb, this derive should never be used on any structs that can't be uniquely identifiable,
/// as all the derived traits here rely on the fact of that uniqueness.
///
/// Example:
/// ```rust,ignore
///
/// // For a struct decorated like this
/// #[derive(IdOrdEqHash)]
/// #[id(type = "Id")]
/// pub struct Domain {
///     /// Identification of this [`Domain`].
///     id: <Self as Identifiable>::Id,
///     /// [`Account`]s of the domain.
///     accounts: AccountsMap,
///     /// [`Asset`](AssetDefinition)s defined of the `Domain`.
///     asset_definitions: AssetDefinitionsMap,
///     /// IPFS link to the `Domain` logo
///     logo: Option<IpfsPath>,
///     /// [`Metadata`] of this `Domain` as a key-value store.
///     metadata: Metadata,
/// }
///
/// // The following impls will be derived
/// impl Identifiable for Domain {
///     type Id = Id;
///     #[inline]
///     fn id(&self) -> &Self::Id {
///         &self.id
///     }
/// }
/// impl core::cmp::PartialOrd for Domain {
///     #[inline]
///     fn partial_cmp(&self, other: &Self) -> Option<core::cmp::Ordering> {
///         Some(self.cmp(other))
///     }
/// }
/// impl core::cmp::Ord for Domain {
///     fn cmp(&self, other: &Self) -> core::cmp::Ordering {
///         self.id().cmp(other.id())
///     }
/// }
/// impl core::cmp::PartialEq for Domain {
///     fn eq(&self, other: &Self) -> bool {
///         self.id() == other.id()
///     }
/// }
/// impl core::cmp::Eq for Domain {}
/// impl core::hash::Hash for Domain {
///     fn hash<H: core::hash::Hasher>(&self, state: &mut H) {
///         self.id().hash(state);
///     }
/// }

/// [`Filter`] is used for code generation of `...Filter` structs and `...EventFilter` enums, as well as
/// implementing the `Filter` trait for both of them.
/// This macro should only be attributed to `Event` enums. E.g. if the event is called `AccountEvent`,
/// then the macro will produce `AccountEventFilter` and `AccountFilter`. The latter will have `new` and
/// field getters defined, and both will have their respective `Filter` trait impls generated.
/// Due to name scoping, the macro currently properly
/// expands only from within the `iroha_data_model` crate as it relies on a few of `crate::prelude`
/// imports. This macro also depends on the naming conventions adopted so far, such as that
/// `Event` enums always have tuple variants with either some sort of `Id` or another `Event` inside
/// of them, as well as that all `Event` inner fields precede `Id` fields in the enum definition.
///
/// Example:
/// ```rust,ignore
/// // For a struct decorated like this
/// #[derive(Filter)]
/// pub enum DomainEvent {
///     Account(AccountEvent),
///     AssetDefinition(AssetDefinitionEvent),
///     Created(DomainId),

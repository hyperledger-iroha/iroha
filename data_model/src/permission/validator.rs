//! Structures, traits and impls related to *runtime* `Validator`s.
//!
//! # Note
//!
//! Currently Iroha 2 has only builtin validators (see `core/src/smartcontracts/permissions`).
//! They are partly using API from this module.
//! In the future they will be replaced with *runtime validators* that use WASM.
//! The architecture of the new validators is quite different from the old ones.
//! That's why some parts of this module may not be used anywhere yet.

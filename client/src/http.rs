    /// Flow consists of the following:
    ///
    /// 1. **Init stage**: establish `WebSocket` connection with Iroha
    /// 2. **Events stage**: wait for messages from Iroha. For each message, decode *some event* from it
    ///     and send back *some "received"* message
    ///
    ///
    ///
    /// This module has a set of abstraction to extract pure data logic from transportation logic. Following sections
    /// describe how to use this module from both **flow implemention** (data side) and
    /// **transport implementation** sides.
    ///
    /// ## Flow implementation
    ///
    /// From data side, you should implement a state machine built on top of these traits:
    ///
    /// - [Init][conn_flow::Init] it is designed to consume its impl struct and produce a tuple, that has 2 items:
    ///   **initial data** to establish WS connection, and the **handler** of the next flow stage â€” **events**.
    ///   Then, transportation side should open a connection, send first message into it, receive message from Iroha
    ///   and pass it into the next handler.
    /// - [Events][conn_flow::Events] handles incoming messages and returns a **binary reply** back Iroha and **some decoded event**.
    ///
    /// Here is an example of how to implement flow in a transport-agnostic manner:
    ///
    /// ```rust
    /// use eyre::{eyre, Result};
    /// use iroha_client::http::{
    ///     ws::conn_flow::{
    ///         Events as FlowEvents, Init as FlowInit,
    ///         InitData,
    ///     },
    ///     Method, RequestBuilder,
    /// };
    ///
    /// struct Init;
    ///
    /// impl<R: RequestBuilder> FlowInit<R> for Init {
    ///     type Next = Events;
    ///
    ///     fn init(self) -> InitData<R, Self::Next> {
    ///         InitData::new(
    ///             R::new(Method::GET, "http://localhost:3000".parse().expect("`localhost` is a valid URL, port `3000` is sensible, `http` is supported")),
    ///             vec![1, 2, 3],
    ///             Events,
    ///         )
    ///     }
    /// }
    ///
    /// struct Events;
    ///
    /// impl FlowEvents for Events {
    ///     type Event = u8;
    ///
    ///     fn message(&self, message: Vec<u8>) -> Result<Self::Event> {
    ///         Ok(message[0])
    ///     }
    /// }
    /// ```
    ///
    /// ## Transport implementation
    ///
    /// You are a library user and want to use Iroha Client with your own HTTP/WS implementation. For such a purpose
    /// the client library should provide an API wrapped into the flow traits. Anyway, firstly you should implement
    /// [`super::RequestBuilder`] trait for your transport.
    ///
    /// Let's take Events API as an example. [`crate::client::Client::events_handler`] creates a struct of
    /// initial WS flow stage - [`crate::client::events_api::flow::Init`].

    ///
    /// ```rust
    /// use eyre::Result;
    /// use url::Url;
    /// use iroha_client::{
    ///     data_model::prelude::EventBox,

## 2026-04-23 Sumeragi main_loop coverage edge follow-up

- `crates/iroha_core/src/sumeragi/main_loop/tests.rs` now adds five more direct unit tests in the recent known-block replay / exact-frontier helper slice so the remaining explicit-target and local-only frontier branches are exercised directly.
- Added a deduplicated explicit-target vote replay case for `maybe_replay_known_block_commit_evidence(...)` that proves duplicate and local peers collapse to one outbound `QcVote` send per unique remote target.
- Added a cached commit-QC replay case for `maybe_replay_known_block_commit_evidence(...)` that proves the helper returns `false` when the explicit target set collapses to the local peer only and therefore the QC replay path has no outbound work to schedule.
- Added three more `frontier_body_next_due(...)` checks: unarmed exact-fetch slots stay idle even with cached targets, leader-stage retries stay idle when a single-peer topology yields no remote leader or voters, and voter-stage retries stay armed when at least one cached remote voter survives leader filtering.
- Focused validation for this follow-up:
  - `cargo fmt --all`
  - `cargo test -p iroha_core --lib known_block_commit_evidence_replay_deduplicates_explicit_vote_targets -- --nocapture`
  - `target/debug/deps/iroha_core-afb8267c04707e87 --exact 'sumeragi::main_loop::tests::known_block_commit_qc_replay_returns_false_for_local_only_explicit_targets' --nocapture`

## 2026-04-23 Sumeragi main_loop coverage tail follow-up

- `crates/iroha_core/src/sumeragi/main_loop/tests.rs` now adds four more direct unit tests in the recent known-block replay / exact-frontier helper slice instead of relying on broader regressions to incidentally hit those branches.
- Added a per-block cooldown case for `maybe_replay_known_block_commit_evidence(...)` that proves the second replay attempt is suppressed before any duplicate network work is scheduled.
- Added a local-only explicit-target case for `maybe_replay_known_block_commit_evidence(...)` that proves the helper returns `false` when the explicit peer set collapses to self and therefore cannot emit outbound recovery traffic.
- Added two exact-frontier cached-target shape checks for `frontier_body_next_due(...)`: leader-stage retries remain armed when only cached voters exist, and voter-stage retries stay idle when the cached voter set collapses to the cached leader only.
- Focused validation for this follow-up:
  - `cargo fmt --all`
  - `cargo test -p iroha_core --lib known_block_commit_evidence_replay_skips_during_cooldown -- --nocapture`
  - `target/debug/deps/iroha_core-afb8267c04707e87 --exact 'sumeragi::main_loop::tests::known_block_commit_evidence_replay_returns_false_for_local_only_explicit_targets' --nocapture`

## 2026-04-22 Sumeragi main_loop coverage follow-up

- `crates/iroha_core/src/sumeragi/main_loop/tests.rs` now adds direct unit coverage for the recent collector / vote-replay / exact-frontier branches instead of only relying on the earlier regression fixtures.
- Added a collector-disabled precommit case that proves `emit_precommit_vote(...)` falls back to the full view-aligned topology when no seeded collector set exists.
- Added a local accepted commit-vote case that proves `handle_vote(...)` records the vote without triggering known-block commit-evidence replay or payload recovery fanout.
- Added direct `frontier_body_next_due(...)` coverage for both derived-target paths: leader-stage scheduling now stays armed when live-roster derivation can supply fetch targets, while voter-stage scheduling still stays idle when derivation yields only the local leader and no remote voters.
- Added direct `known_block_commit_qc_recovery_targets(...)` coverage for both empty-input fallback branches: cached vote-roster recovery for far-future rounds with preserved roster evidence, and live commit-topology recovery when no vote-roster evidence exists.
- Added two more exact-frontier scheduler checks: far-future slots now prove the final fallback to `effective_commit_topology()`, and body-present slots now prove exact fetch stays idle when no same-round commit-QC repair is active.
- Added direct `deterministic_elected_roster_from_candidates(...)` coverage for two narrow roster-election guards: zero requested roster length now proves the helper still elects one candidate, and NPoS `max_validators` now proves candidate truncation happens before the requested roster-size cap.
- Added direct `frontier_body_next_due(...)` deadline checks for the two timing branches that were still only covered indirectly: before ingress grace elapses the helper returns `observed_at + authoritative_body_ingress_fetch_grace()`, and after grace elapses it returns `last_fetch_at + retry_window`.
- Added direct `maybe_replay_known_block_commit_evidence(...)` coverage for the “no new progress” guard: once the same round’s replay state has already been sent and neither vote count nor commit-QC state changes, the helper now has a focused test proving it returns `false` without scheduling more traffic.
- Added direct NPoS roster-unavailability source coverage for the empty-commit-topology path: one test proves the helper stays on the multi-peer local lane when that lane is available, and another proves it falls back to the full published active validator roster when the local validator has no lane assignment.
- Added two more exact-frontier due checks: body-present slots still schedule retries when same-round commit-QC repair remains actionable, and passive-catchup slots stay excluded from exact body retry scheduling even when cached targets exist.

## 2026-04-22 Sumeragi targeted main_loop regression sweep

- `crates/iroha_core/src/sumeragi/main_loop/commit.rs` now keeps the initial local commit/precommit emit on the seeded collector set plus explicit parallel fanout, instead of widening that very first send through the generic commit-evidence replay path.
- `crates/iroha_core/src/sumeragi/main_loop/votes.rs` now limits automatic known-block commit-evidence replay to non-local accepted commit votes, so a locally emitted precommit is not redundantly fanned out to the whole topology before the collector retry logic takes over.
- `crates/iroha_core/src/sumeragi/main_loop.rs` now lets `frontier_body_next_due(...)` account for derived voter fallback when the leader lane has no usable remote leader target, and NPoS roster-unavailability candidate selection now scopes lane discovery from the active topology rather than the raw cached snapshot.
- `crates/iroha_core/src/sumeragi/main_loop/tests.rs` now uses PRF-aligned leader/view discovery for the affected proposal and vote fixtures, searches RBC subset cases without assuming the local peer is outside the deterministic rebroadcast base set, and expects partial-session payload rebroadcasts to queue only the chunks that are still locally present.
- This clears the reported `sumeragi::main_loop` failure cluster around collector targeting, idle frontier recovery, RBC rescue/rebroadcast fixtures, same-slot vote-collision validation, exact-frontier retry scheduling, and roster-unavailability source selection.
- Focused validation for this slice:

## 2026-04-22 Roadmap Audit

- `roadmap.md` was re-audited against the current repo and rewritten around repo-backed unfinished issues instead of speculative or stale reminders.
- Removed the obsolete `iroha_torii_shared` `AccountLabel` import blocker; the current file no longer imports `AccountLabel`.
- Removed the old trigger `get_numeric(...)` follow-up; the free helper has already been removed in `kotodama_lang`, so any future trigger work must be scoped to a concrete repo-local test gap.
- Promoted concrete open gaps into the roadmap where evidence exists today, including the `ivm_prebuild.rs` / `integration_tests/build.rs` sample-list drift and the lack of a repo-wide translation metadata audit.

## 2026-04-22 Roadmap Cleanup

- `roadmap.md` now tracks unfinished work only. Completed history was removed from the roadmap so it stops acting like a second status log.
- Historical completed roadmap-only epics were archived here at summary level instead of staying in the roadmap:
  - Kagami NPoS-ready network generation, explicit consensus-mode cutover tooling, peer/block signature hardening, and bootstrap-from-trusted-peer genesis fetch are complete.
  - Kagami/Mochi Iroha3 profiles, account-identity / alias unification, CLI output normalization, CI TODO cleanup, and offline QR storm follow-up work are complete.
  - Soracloud platform MVP and Soracloud model-training / weight-lifecycle work are complete.
  - Kotodama / IVM developer-experience observability work is complete.
  - Asset ID, account-literal, and asset-alias lease cleanup follow-ups are complete.
  - The tracked repository TODO inventory had no actionable code/runtime/SDK/test/tooling/docs TODOs at the time of the scan; only reference-only TODO mentions remained.

## 2026-04-22 Recent Completed Follow-ups

- `crates/iroha_core/src/sumeragi/main_loop/tests.rs` now salts harness-generated peer seeds per instance and folds the elected signer into the helper heartbeat seed, which eliminates helper block-hash collisions across parallel RBC roster tests and closes the stale-cache replacement coverage gaps around same-epoch roster recovery.
- `crates/iroha_torii/src/zk_attachments.rs` and `crates/iroha_torii/tests/zk_attachments_subprocess.rs` now cover the remaining sanitizer subprocess branches exercised in the latest pass: launcher fallback, timeout handling, response decoding, malformed compressed payloads, child-entry validation, spawn failures, and reader timeout/error paths.
- The recent `iroha_core` frontier-slot helper slices are complete: pending-wrapper liveness, active-owner-state helpers, validation-inflight preservation, commit-inflight preservation, and later-view lock-state guard coverage were all added with focused tests.
- The recent `iroha_torii` manifest-routing slices are complete: helper coverage, direct handler coverage, malformed-payload coverage, and direct-routing coverage are all in place with focused test runs.
- The recent `iroha_data_model` bridge helper / verifier / serialization follow-up slices are complete with focused crate validation.

## 2026-04-22 Completed Follow-up Archive

- Permissioned preserved-peer stable soak: green on the patched tree; the remaining follow-up is the fresh-binary rerun from the current branch.
- Permissioned missing-QC recovery: landed, covered by focused regressions, and aligned with the current reschedule / local-vote behavior.
- Retained RBC summary refresh: landed; the previously failing large-payload NPoS regression is green.
- Permission-cache replay: landed and green.
- Integration failure sweep: the reported targeted regressions were fixed and covered by focused validation.
- MCP writer-profile alignment: landed; mutation-capable MCP endpoint tests now opt into the documented writer profile and the targeted test file is green.
